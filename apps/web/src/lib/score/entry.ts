	   between them, which makes three readings of one bar that cannot be
	   compared with each other.

	   THE CAUSE was here: the unit used to be `lcm(den, beatType)`, where `den`
	   is the denominator of what the measure HOLDS. So the unit was derived
	   from the content and re-derived on every change to it, and adding one
	   eighth to a bar of quarters silently halved the beat the tag counted in.

	   Pinned to `beatType`, the second number is always the signature's own
	   numerator, so a bar in 4 by 4 reads `N of 4` from the first correction to
	   the last and two readings can be held against each other.

	   THE COST, and it is the right one to pay: `actual` may now be fractional,
	   because a bar of eighths in 4 by 4 is not a whole number of quarters.
	   Four quarters and an eighth reads `4.5 of 4` where it used to read
