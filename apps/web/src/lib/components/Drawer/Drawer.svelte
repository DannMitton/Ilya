	/* ── THE SILHOUETTE AND THE BOOKMARK TAB ARE GONE (N.108 increment 1a) ──
	   Ruled by Dann 2026-09-02 on his walk of `2c1cecf`: the desk has no pull,
	   no chevron and no collapsed state, and the phone's pull is a horizontal
	   bar on the bottom edge instead of a tab on the right.

	   WHAT LEFT WITH THEM, and every one of these was ruled once: `LIP_W` 20
	   and `LIP_H` 152 (2026-08-19, 2026-08-21), the one-outline silhouette
	   drawn at `docs/sessions/lip-handle-silhouette_r1_2026-08-20.html` with
	   its mitred junctions and its squircle cubic (2026-08-20), the drawer's
	   `bind:clientHeight`, which existed only so that path could have user
	   units, the drop-shadow lift the outline needed, the `--lip-grey`, the
	   coarse-pointer touch extension, the two measured optical nudges of the
	   chevron, and the vertical DRAWER label increment 1 built on the tab four
	   hours ago.

	   NONE OF IT IS A DEFECT BEING FIXED. It was right for a drawer that slid
	   in from the left and had to show a handle when it was gone. The desk's
	   drawer never goes now, so it needs no handle; the phone's comes from the
	   bottom, so its handle is a bar across the bottom. The reasoning is kept
	   here rather than in the file's history because the shape may come back
	   if the motion ever does.

	   `docs/sessions/drawing-n108-pull_r2_2026-09-02.png` is the drawing this

	   ONLY, because the paper scrolls under a thumb all day and an up-swipe

	/* The takeover's scroll, E.27: exit "restores the station accordion in its
	   prior state." The RETRACT states survive on their own, because nothing
	   here unmounts. The scroll does not: `display: none` drops the box, and a
	   box with no layout has no scrollTop to keep.

	   `$effect.pre`, NOT `$effect`, and this was MEASURED rather than reasoned.
	   A plain `$effect` runs AFTER the DOM update, so by the time it read
	   `scrollTop` the element was already stowed and it read 0; backing out of
	   a drawer scrolled to 300 landed at 0, which is the thing this code
	   exists to prevent. A pre-effect runs before the update, while the
	   element still has its layout. The RESTORE is the mirror case and has to
	   wait for the layout to come back, so it is deferred one frame.

	   THE ONE SELF-SCROLL IN THE WHOLE DRAWER, N.108 increment 3, and it
	   rides in the same effect. N.108 §2: "the drawer never scrolls itself,
	   except once, on entry to the calibration takeover." The singer must
	   land on the ritual and not part-way down it, and the drawer's own
	   scroll is held and given back on exit so they land where they were.

	   IT IS WRITTEN ON THE WAY OUT, NOT ON THE WAY IN, AND THAT WAS MEASURED
	   RATHER THAN CHOSEN. The prototype sets `takeoverBody.scrollTop = 0` on
	   entry (`:602`), where the element is already showing. Here the element
	   is `display: none` until the update lands, so the write has to be
	   deferred, and a deferred write LOSES: `display: none` does not discard
	   this box's scroll offset, Chrome restores it when the box gets its
	   layout back, and that restoration happens after `requestAnimationFrame`
	   runs. Observed on the production build, 2026-09-03: scroll the ritual
	   to 200, back out, re-enter, and the ritual comes back at 200 with the
	   rAF write already spent.

	   ON THE WAY OUT the box still has its layout, so `scrollTop = 0` is one
	   synchronous write with nothing to race, and the next entry is at the
	   top by construction. It is the same argument the stow above makes for
	   reading `scrollTop` in a pre-effect, used in the other direction.
	   NOTHING IS PAINTED SCROLLED: this runs before the DOM update that
	   stows the box, so the reset and the hide land in one frame. */

		<!-- THE CALIBRATION TAKEOVER (N.73 S3 ship one, redressed at N.108

		     conditional mount. It is a SIBLING of the three groups above and
		     hides all of them, which is E.27's "replaces the entire drawer":
		     the groups, their bands and the voice line are not visible during
		     the ritual. Its back affordance reuses `inspector.back`, a
		     ratified string, so the takeover writes no new French.

		     THE NEW DRESS IS ONE GROUP, GROWN. Ruled by Dann 2026-09-02:
		     calibration stays a takeover and Design restyles it in the new
		     dress. So this is a fourth frame at the 20 px surface radius,
		     wearing the Score markup band, because the ritual IS the Score
		     markup group's Voice station filling the drawer. The prototype
		     draws it at `.takeover-frame`, `.takeover-band`,
		     `.takeover-title` (`n108-drawer-prototype_r2_2026-09-02.html`).

		     BACK IS ON THE LEFT OF THE BAND, which is the build brief §1.2
		     overriding the prototype: "Back sits on the LEFT of the
		     takeover's band, where `Drawer.svelte:619` puts it today. The
		     prototype has it on the right; reverse the flex order." It is
		     first in the markup, which is that reversal.

		     THE BAND SAYS THE GROUP AND THE TITLE SAYS THE STATION. Two
		     labels rather than one, and the prototype gives the reason: the
		     band is the group's name, so the station the ritual grew from
		     has to say its own. -->

<!-- ── THE PULL (N.108 increment 1a), PHONE ONLY ────────────────────────
     `docs/sessions/drawing-n108-pull_r2_2026-09-02.png`, ruled by Dann
     2026-09-02: one horizontal labelled pull on the bottom edge, 44 px tall,
     drawer paper, reading PAPER when the drawer is up and DRAWER when the
     paper is up. One control, one place, both states.

     THIS AMENDS THE 2026-08-19 RULING IN BOTH ITS PARTS
     (`claude/ruling-drawer-horizontal-motion-and-bare-chevron_2026-08-19.md`).
     That ruling withdrew the phone's vertical motion as a form-factor
     concession and made the pull a bare chevron. His words tonight: "The
     vertical model for mobile that you offered is fine. Let's go with that."
     So the motion is vertical again and the pull carries a word again.

     A SIBLING OF THE DRAWER, NOT A CHILD, and that is load-bearing: the drawer
     translates off the bottom of the screen and the pull must not go with it.

     THE CHEVRON POINTS THE WAY THE DRAWER WILL MOVE when pressed, which is the
     rule this drawer's chevron has always followed: down with the drawer up,
     up with the paper up. It leads the word, as the drawing draws it.

     ON THE DESK IT DOES NOT EXIST. Not hidden: not rendered. There is nothing
     for it to do, because the drawer is always present. -->

		   shape lifted off the desk. There is no outline and no handle.

		   gone it would have drawn a shadow around each group's 20 px corners

	   to fully become a floating control set." No fill behind the groups; they
	   float directly on the desk of whichever document is showing.

	   WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE SLAB, and it is worth keeping because the fault
	   was in the idea and not in the value. Increment 1 gave this box the
	   desk's surround, keyed off `data-tab`, on the ruling of 2026-09-02
	   ("the slab takes the desk's surround"). Two painted boxes then had to
	   agree, and they did not: the drawer showed the transcription desk's
	   corner under the Score markup document, because the class that keys the
	   desk and the attribute that keyed the slab are set at different moments.
	   ONE PAINTED DESK CANNOT MISMATCH ITSELF, so `.app-content` in
	   `+page.svelte` paints it now, once, under the drawer and the paper both,
	   and this box paints nothing at all.

	   `--slab-fill` and the two `data-tab` rules that set it are deleted with
	   it. `data-tab` returns to what N.73 S3 ship two kept it for: a mark on
	   the drawer that a harness can read, which no selector uses. */

		/* ── THE GROUPS FLOAT, SO THEY NEED AIR ON EVERY SIDE ─────
		   N.108 increment 1a. With the slab gone the groups sit on the desk,
		   and a 20 px corner against the viewport's own edge is a corner that
		   has been sliced off rather than drawn. Dann's words for what he
		   wanted are "allowing the Drawer to fully become a floating control
		   set", and `drawing-n108-pull_r2_2026-09-02.png` draws desk on every
		   side of the cards.

		   16 px IS THE DRAWER'S OWN INSET AND NOT A NEW VALUE. It is the 1rem
		   that `.root-panel`, `.drawer-anchor-top` and `.drawer-anchor-bottom`
		   each spent before N.108, ruled by Dann 2026-08-20 when he required
		   every station rule in the drawer to share one inset. The stations'
		   own 18 px lives inside the group; this is the group's own margin
		   from the desk.

		   THE TOP IS 16 NOW, AND IT WAS 0. RULED BY DANN 2026-09-03 on his walk
		   of `42f6871`: "negative space between the Piece band and the Ilya
		   banner. This will increase the illusion that the controls float. On
		   my screen, simply moving the controls down a few pixels would be
		   sufficient." His ruling REVERSES what stood here at increment 1a,
		   which is reproduced so the next reader sees what was traded and does
		   not undo him: "the first group's 20 px corners now meet the slab at
		   the top, which is the same join they make at the bottom", and "16 px
		   there costs 16 px of height, and at 1366 x 768 on a coarse pointer
		   the opening state then overruns its box by 10 px". The slab is gone,
		   so the first join is now against the viewport rather than against a
		   fill, and the height is the cost he accepted by ruling.

		   THE FOOT IS 12, not 16, and it was 12 before: it is
		   `.root-panel:last-child`'s 40 px replaced at increment 1 by the
		   prototype's own value, and nothing about the bottom changed here. */

	   `:global`, and deliberately: the stations are authored by five other

	/* ── THE ANCHORS ARE GONE (N.108 increment 1) ────────────
	   `.drawer-anchor`, `.drawer-anchor-top` and `.drawer-anchor-bottom` are
	   deleted with the two pinned regions they dressed. Three of the four
	   declarations of the drawer's ONE boundary treatment lived here: the top
	   anchor's 2px sage down-facing rule, ruled by Dann 2026-08-20, and the
	   bottom anchor's 2px lavender up-facing one, ruled the same day. THE
	   RULING THEY CARRY IS NOT REVERSED, IT IS SPENT: it said a drawer with
	   one horizontal is worth more than a drawer that grades its horizontals,
	   and the new dress has no horizontals to grade. A band of full colour is
	   what says "a region ends here" now, and a 1px hairline is what separates
	   two stations inside one region. The fourth declaration, `.takeover-head`,
	   survives untouched below and is increment 3's to restyle.

	   THE LAVENDER IS NOT LOST EITHER. It was the voice's rule under the S0
	   slate of 2026-08-19; the voice is inside the Score markup group now, and
	   that group's band is `--lang-chip-marked`, the same hue one step down.
	   The ruling survives in a stronger form, which is the argument Design
	   made for the takeover's own rule and it holds here for the same reason. */

	   Takes .drawer-content's place in the column when it has the drawer:
	   same flex:1, same min-height:0, so a long ritual scrolls inside itself
	   rather than pushing the back affordance off the top.

	   THE INSET IS `.drawer-content`'s OWN, repeated rather than shared,
	   because these two boxes never exist at once and neither can be the
	   other's parent. 16 px at the sides so the frame's 20 px corners have
	   desk beside them, 12 px at the foot, and 16 px at the top since Dann's
	   ruling of 2026-09-03: the same three values and the same reasoning as
	   the groups, written out where `.drawer-content` writes them. The top
	   moves with the groups' top or the frame jumps 16 px up the moment the
	   ritual is entered, which is the one motion this drawer does not make.

	   IT PAINTS NOTHING NOW. The fill moved onto `.takeover-frame`, which is
	   the box with the corners; a fill out here would square them off

	   THE ARROW IS THE STRING'S OWN. `inspector.back` is `\u2190 Back`

	/* ── THE TAB SLIDE IS GONE FROM THE DRAWER (N.108 increment 3) ────
	   RULED BY DANN 2026-09-03 on his walk of increment 2: the drawer stays
	   still on a tab change. Four rules stood here, `tabSlideFromRight` and
	   `tabSlideFromLeft` applied to `.drawer-content` itself and to any
	   descendant carrying the class, with the two keyframes they used; the
	   reduced-motion block that turned them off went with them.

	   IT IS STILL ON THE PAPER. `.main-content` in `+page.svelte` keeps the
	   same 175 ms slide and its own copy of the keyframes, so the document
	   still enters from the side the singer travelled. The drawer does not,
	   and that is the whole of N.108 in one line: THE DRAWER DOES NOT
	   REARRANGE UNDER THE SINGER'S HAND. Both of Studio's documents share
	   this drawer byte for byte since N.73 S2, so a slide here was animating
	   an arrival that never happened.

	   `tabTransitionClass` LEFT THIS COMPONENT WITH THEM. It was the only
	   thing that put the class on `.drawer-content`, and nothing else in the
	   drawer carries it, so the `:global` pair had no subject either. */

	   word. It replaces `.drawer-lip`, `.lip-silhouette`, `.sil-fill`,
	   `.sil-line`, `--lip-grey`, `.lip-chevron` and the two measured optical
	   nudges, all deleted; the script above records what each was for.

	   44 px ON EVERY POINTER, not only a coarse one. It is the ruled height
	   and it is also the touch floor, so the two agree by construction and no
	   `@media (pointer: coarse)` block is needed to raise it. The old tab
	   needed one because it painted 20 px and had to reach 44.

	   hairline above it separates it from whatever it is sitting on. NO
	   SHADOW: nothing in this drawer is lifted any more.

	   is. z-index 70 clears the drawer's own 60 and stays under the loupe and
