/**
 * N.108 increment 1: THE RETURNING SINGER.
 *
 * `ilya:openStations` is a WIRE VALUE. A browser that has been to Ilya before
 * holds ship B's five ids, and this build understands eight different ones, so
 * every returning singer runs the migration exactly once on their next visit
 * and there is no second chance to get it right. That is what these tests pin.
 *
 * THE EXPECTATIONS ARE COPIED FROM THE BRIEF, not read back out of
 * `sections.svelte.ts`, which is this repository's standing condition on an
 * acceptance test: no expectation may take its value from the mechanism under
 * test. The mapping is `docs/sessions/brief-n108-build_r1_2026-09-02.md` §3,
 * which quotes Design's revision 2 §4.4: "map `piece` to `metadata`, `songs`
 * to `repertoire`, `analysis` to `analysis`, `shiftLyrics` to `underlay`; drop
 * `source` and anything unrecognized; on a phone keep only the first
 * survivor."
 *
 * `SectionSet` ITSELF IS NOT EXERCISED HERE. It holds `$state` and a
 * `localStorage` write, and this repository's vitest runs in the `node`
 * environment with neither; the file's own header says that is why every
 * decision it makes lives in a free function. `migrateOpenStations` is that
 * function.
