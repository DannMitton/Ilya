/**
 * sections.svelte.ts — THE DRAWER'S ONE RETRACTION MECHANISM.
 *
 * N.65, the drawer's stations, ship B. Dann's ruling of 2026-08-21: "I'd like
 * a retraction chevron applied to every header. Every header begins a section
 * that is retractable and expandable."
 *
 * EXTRACTED, NOT WRITTEN FRESH. `Drawer.svelte` already held this exact shape
 * inline as `expandedSections`, a `Set<string>`, with a `toggleSection(id)`
 * that rebuilt the set rather than mutating it, and it drove Learn and Guide's
 * table of contents. The brief's instruction was "extract it so the drawer has
 * one mechanism, do not write a second," so this file is that code moved out,
 * with the reassign-rather-than-mutate discipline kept: Svelte does not proxy
 * a `Set`, so a fresh set assigned to the field is what makes a reader run.
 *
 * TWO INSTANCES OF ONE MECHANISM, NOT TWO MECHANISMS. The table of contents
 * keeps its own instance, which persists nothing and holds heading ids. The
 * stations take a second, which persists and holds station ids. They are
 * separate state because they are separate things: a remembered table of
 * contents is not what §B.4 asks to remember, and one shared set would have
 * written Learn's open units into the stations' key.
 *
 * THE PERSISTENCE IS IMPERATIVE, NOT AN EFFECT. Every mutation runs through
 * `toggle` and `open`, so the write sits at the two mutation sites and needs
 * no effect context. `SongDocument` reaches the same conclusion for the same
 * reason and its header says so: this repository's vitest runs in the `node`
 * environment, where a `.svelte.ts` module compiles in server mode, `$state`
 * is a plain assignment and `$effect` compiles to nothing. Anything with a
 * decision in it belongs in plain TypeScript, which is why `parseOpenSections`
 * below is a free function and this class holds fields and writes.

 * THE STORED SHAPE CARRIES ITS OWN VERSION. N.108 increment 1a.

 * Ruled by Dann 2026-09-02 on his walk of `2c1cecf`: the migration "lands
 * every singer on the opening state once: drop the old set, write the empty
 * array, so nothing is open except the intake." His own drawer had come back
 * with Repertoire and Analysis open and pushed the Score markup group off the
 * bottom, which is the defect this closes.
 *
 * WHY A VERSION AND NOT JUST AN EMPTY ARRAY, and this is the whole reason the
 * shape changed. "Once" needs a mark. After increment 1 a returning singer's
 * key already holds NEW ids, `["repertoire","analysis"]`, and a bare array
 * cannot say whether that was written by increment 1 or by the singer's own
 * hand five seconds ago. Reset every boot and no station could ever stay open;
 * reset only sets holding OLD ids and Dann's own drawer is not reset, which is
 * the one case he reported. So the SHAPE is the mark: a bare array is what
 * every build before 1a wrote, and an object is what 1a writes.
 *
 * IT IS STILL ONE KEY AND ONE SAVE SITE. N.27 is open and no second silent
 * save may enter; `#write` below is the same single writer it has always been,
 * and the only thing that changed is the bytes it puts there.
 *
 * AN UNRECOGNISED OR CORRUPT VALUE FALLS BACK AND DOES NOT THROW (§B.4), the
 * pattern N.73 S3 ship two established for `ilya:activeTab` in
 * `restoreSurface`. A corrupt value reads as version 0, so it is reset with
