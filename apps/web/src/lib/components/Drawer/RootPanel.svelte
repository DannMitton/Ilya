	 * it is what the three groups make structural. Analysis is with the text
	 * because Text is a group.
	 *
	 * SOURCE BECAME THE INTAKE AND LOST ITS HEADER. Ruled 2026-09-02: the

	 * unchanged in increment 1, the textarea above and the score drop below,
	 * which is increment 2's to unify.

	 * Print/Export/Import row shares the same relationship to the score field
	 * as the Clear text/Transcribe row does to the text field above it"). The
	 * three-group map names it: Piece holds "Export and import". That ruling
	 * is superseded by the map, and the row's own arrangement inside the
	 * station is untouched.
	 *
	 * THERE IS NO `.root-panel` WRAPPER. The stations are direct children of
	 * the group, because the group frame owns their inset and their boundary
	 * (`Drawer.svelte`'s `.group :global(.station)`), and a wrapper between
	 * them and the frame would put the band's adjacency rule out of reach.

<!-- ── EXPORT AND IMPORT. N.108: the binder row is a STATION in Piece now,
     which the three-group map names. It was a bare row at the foot of Source,
     by Dann's ruling of N.65 ship B §B.6: "I do not think we need an Output
     section articulated. What I want is the appearance that the
     Print/Export/Import row shares the same relationship to the score field
     as the Clear text/Transcribe row does to the text field above it."

     THAT RULING IS SUPERSEDED BY THE MAP, not overturned by this file. What it
     was protecting was the row's relationship to a field, and the field it sat
     under is the intake, which is now headerless and never closed; a bare row
     at the foot of a headerless station would be the orphan control the spec's
     §3.3 forbids. The row's own arrangement inside the station is untouched.

     `Export all songs` is a third cell, shown only above one song, because
     with one song it says the same thing as the button beside it. THE GRID IS
     UNCHANGED, `repeat(3, 1fr)`: two buttons where there is one song, three
     where there is more than one, on one row either way. Narrowing it to two
     columns is a separate ruling and this ship does not make it. -->

	/* ── THE STATION RECIPE MOVED TO THE FRAME (N.108) ───────
	   `.section`, `.section + .section`, `.section.shut` and the two exemption
	   comments are gone from this file. What they declared was: a 2px sage
	   rule between stations, 6px above a label, 12px below a body, 6px below a
	   shut one, and no rule above whatever was first in the scroll.

	   EVERY ONE OF THOSE IS NOW ONE DECLARATION IN `Drawer.svelte`, on
	   `.group :global(.station)` and its two neighbours, for the reason that
	   file gives: the inset and the boundary are properties of the FRAME, and
	   five components were declaring them. That is the same argument
	   `StationHeader.svelte` makes for the label.

	   DANN'S RULINGS INSIDE THEM ARE NOT LOST, and here is where each went:
	   - "one rule per boundary, drawn by the station below it, none above the
	     first" (2026-08-27) is `.group-band + .station { border-top: none }`.
	   - "a shut station is the same height as its twins" (2026-08-21) is
	     satisfied by construction: the row IS the station when it is shut, and
	     every row is the same box.
	   - The 2px sage rule itself (2026-08-20) is retired inside a group and
	     replaced by a 1px hairline, because inside a frame it is a station
	     that ends and not a region. The band says the region.
	   - The asymmetry, a label close to the rule above it and a body given air
	     below it (2026-08-20), survives as the header's 8px and the body's
	     12px. */

	/* A station's contents, as a box the header is NOT inside. That is what
	   makes the header's own 0.4rem the whole gap to the first entry, which
	   is Dann's ruling 2. Put the header in the flex column instead and the
	   column's gap adds to it, which is exactly how SONGS came to measure
	   12.39px where every other station measured 6.39px. Twinned on
	   SongList's `.station-body`. */
	.station-body {
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: column;
		gap: 6px;
	}


	/* ── ANALYSIS'S RULES LEFT WITH ANALYSIS (N.108) ─────────
	   `.console-section`, `.console-placeholder-body`, `.placeholder-hint`,
	   `.result-summary` and `.result-hidden` are `AnalysisStation.svelte`'s

	   that writes the markup and the markup went to the Text group. */
