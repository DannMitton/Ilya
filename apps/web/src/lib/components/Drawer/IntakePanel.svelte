	 * N.108-5, RULED BY DANN 2026-09-07: "The intake becomes its own group band
	 * between Piece and Text, named INPUT, painted sage like Text (hue names
	 * place: it is text); it holds the whole intake frame (field, receipts,
	 * Choose a file, the drop hint, the button) and nothing else; Piece keeps
	 * the name, metadata, repertoire, and export and import."
	 *
	 * EXTRACTED FROM `RootPanel.svelte`, NOT WRITTEN FRESH. Every line of the
	 * markup, every rule and every comment on both came across verbatim. A band
	 * cannot be drawn around part of one component's output, so the part had to
	 * become a component; nothing about what it draws changed.
	 *
	 * IT IS STILL HEADERLESS AND STILL NEVER CLOSED, the 2026-09-02 ruling: the
	 * intake has no station row and no id in the drawer's open set. That is
	 * also why the migration Dann asked for has nothing to add. A station with
	 * no id cannot be stored shut, so INPUT stands open for every singer,
	 * returning or new, by construction rather than by a stored value.
	 * Recorded as a DESK DEFAULT in the N.108-5 memo.
	 *
	 * WHAT `RootPanel` KEPT: Repertoire and the binder, which are Piece's.
	 *
	 * THE BUTTON FAMILY IS DECLARED TWICE ON PURPOSE. `.action-btn`,
	 * `.btn-ghost` and `.btn-primary` are copied from `RootPanel.svelte` value
	 * for value, because Svelte scopes a rule to the file that writes the
	 * markup. `SongList.svelte`, `VoiceAnchor.svelte` and `CalibrationWizard`
	 * each say the same thing in their own headers, so this is the tree's habit
	 * and not a new one. **Change one and change all four.**

<!-- ── THE INTAKE. N.108, ruled 2026-09-02: it has NO STATION ROW and it is
     never closed. Source's header, its chevron and its id are gone with the
     retraction; `source` is the one old wire value the migration drops,
     because a station that cannot close has nothing to store.

     ITS OWN CONTENTS ARE UNTOUCHED IN INCREMENT 1. Two intakes, the textarea
     above and the score drop below, exactly as they ship. Unifying them into
     one field is increment 2, and this ship deliberately does not begin it.

     WHAT SOURCE'S HEADER USED TO DO, the label, is done by an accessible name
     instead. It is not drawn: the intake is the only unlabelled thing in the
     drawer and it is unlabelled because it is always there, which is the
     whole of the ruling. `source.heading` is a ratified string with ratified
     French, so nothing new is written for it.

     THE DICTIONARY ERROR CAME HERE. It was first in `.root-panel`, above
     everything; there is no "above everything" any more, and what it reports
     is the dictionary that Transcribe needs, so it reports where that button
     is. -->

	<!-- ═══ THE ONE FIELD (N.108 increment 2) ═══════════════════════════
	     It was two: a textarea for the poem and a drop zone for the score,
	     side by side under one heading since N.73 S2. It is one now, and the
	     kind is decided by what arrives rather than by which box it was put
	     in. The frame is Design's r2 prototype at `:190`, a neutral dashed
	     rule around the whole intake; the field inside it is the textarea,
	     unchanged in font, size and behaviour.

	     THE DASHED RULE IS THE DROP AFFORDANCE, and it is neutral on purpose.
	     "Hue names place" ruled sage for the text intake and lavender for the
	     score intake (Dann, 2026-07-13, ratified since). There is one place
	     now, so there is one hue and it is neither of theirs. Design drew it
	     that way and marked the fill a placeholder; it is Dann's on the walk.

	     THE DROP TARGET IS THE WHOLE FRAME, receipts and buttons included, so
	     a singer who already has a poem can still drop a score without
	     hunting for a strip of empty field. -->

		     consolidate these and find a reasonable place for the user to
		     perform their file retrieval."

		     WHAT THE ICON MEANT IS NOW A QUESTION RATHER THAN A BUTTON. It
		     existed because pressing it was how a singer said "this picture is
		     text, not music"; the increment 2 comment said so in as many words,
		     "the two stay apart because the button a singer presses is what says
		     which they meant". One picker cannot say it that way, so the picture
		     asks in place, exactly as a PDF has since increment 2, and the poem
		     answer runs the same OCR. `ScoreUploader.take` holds both questions.

		     A DROPPED PICTURE NOW ASKS TOO. It went straight to the score reader
		     before, on the brief's "a photograph goes to the reader"; that rule
		     assumed the camera icon was the other way in, and the icon is gone.

		     go here too, or you can choose a file." with the last three words
		     as the link and the Choose a file pill gone.

		     THE OPPOSITE GUARD FROM THE DROP HINT, and deliberately: this line

		     sits here now, under the score receipt, live whenever a score is
		     present. Nothing about the gesture changed: a click on a syllable
		     moves the SABB and placement stays in the loupe.

		     UNDER THE SCORE RECEIPT RATHER THAN THE POEM'S, because the line
		     exists only when the score does. Drawing r2, plate 1, marks that

		     draws, so it needs no translation and no plural agreement.

		     COLLAPSED, THE WHOLE ROW IS THE BUTTON, which is why the station

	   THE PROTOTYPE'S OWN RULE, `:190`: a 1px DASHED neutral border at ink
	   0.28, the tree's 4px control radius, `--paper-light` as the fill, 12px of
	   padding. Dashed because the frame takes a drop; neutral because there is
	   one intake and "hue names place" has one place to name. Design marked the
	   fill a placeholder and this ship carries that forward rather than
	   inventing a different one: no hex is written here that `app.css` does not
	   already hold.

	   THE FILL IS ON THIS BOX AND THE FIELD INSIDE IT IS TRANSPARENT. That was
	   the watermark's stacking once; the watermark was retired 2026-09-03 and
	   the arrangement is kept because it is what the field looks like. Moving
	   the fill back onto the textarea would change the frame, which this
	   ruling did not ask for.

	   `position: relative` STAYS WITH NO CAMERA TO CONTAIN. It was the
	   watermark's containing block, then the OCR button's, and both are gone
	   (N.108 increments 2 and 4). It is kept because `.dragging` paints this

	   inside the intake, which took that 18 px, so a second one would push
	   them 36 px in. Their hairlines, headers, bodies and motion stay the
	   drawer's, which is what makes them the two plain rows the ruling asks
	   for. Two classes deep, so the rule outranks the drawer's
	   `.group .station` whatever order the bundle loads the two sheets in.

	   THE FOLD'S OWN RULES WENT WITH IT: its hairline, its state-line recipe,
	   and its copy of the drawer's motion. The hairline above Notation is the
	   drawer's own station hairline now, drawn by the station rather than by a
