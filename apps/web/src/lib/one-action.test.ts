/**
 * Tests for N.108-5's text join.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST AS A GATE RATHER THAN AS A WALK. A walk shows the happy
 * paths: reload and the page is drawn, paste and it follows, type and it
 * follows after the pause. What a walk cannot show in one pass is the boot
 * case where the dictionary is still loading, and it cannot show the two
 * cases this rule must never cause, which are a pipeline that re-runs over
 * text it has already read and a timer held open by an empty field. Both are
 * invisible, and the first one resets the singer's own stress overrides every
 * time it happens.
 *
 * NO DOM HERE. `apps/web` runs vitest with no DOM environment, so these pass a
 * plain object and read a verdict. The timer and the effects are
 * `+page.svelte`'s.
