/**
 * N.108-5. WHENEVER TEXT IS PRESENT, THE TRANSCRIPTION EXISTS.
 *
 * RULED BY DANN 2026-09-07, widening his own ruling of 2026-09-04. The first
 * one made Transcribe and Continue to analysis one action: *"I think one
 * should invoke the other."* The second widens the join from "a score is
 * present" to **"text is present"**: at boot, if the field holds text, Ilya
 * transcribes once the dictionary is ready, score or no score; a paste
 * transcribes at once; typing transcribes after a short pause, never per
 * keystroke.
 *
 * WHAT IT CLOSES. N.67 step 4b's boot asymmetry, whole. `lines` is session
 * state that is never stored, and nothing at boot ever ran the pipeline, so a
 * reload of a song with a poem in it drew a blank Transcription page and said
 * *"Enter your Cyrillic text in the drawer on the left"* while the drawer
 * plainly held the text. Dann walked into exactly that on 2026-09-07.
 *
 * THE BUTTON STAYS, and that is his ruling too. It keeps its explicit act;
 * this is not a replacement for it.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS THE HALF THAT CAN BE TESTED. The timer, the effects and the
 * uploader reach live in `+page.svelte`, where no vitest in this repository
 * can reach them. What is here is the decision, lifted out on purpose: a rule
 * in a `.svelte` file is a rule nothing can pin.
 *
 * PAIRINGS ARE UNTOUCHED BY EVERY PATH THROUGH HERE. Re-seating a score when
 * the text changes under it is **N.112**, the next item in the text-to-score
 * sequence Dann ruled on 2026-09-06, and doing it here would be building N.112
 * early under another name.

/**
 * Which queue a REBUILD of the placements must read. N.112, walk finding 2.
 *
 * RULED BY DANN 2026-09-07, on his walk of `b191867`: *"make the rebuild use
 * the poem whenever text is present."* After Start placement over the last note
 * of the piece came back bare, because the rebuild had run from the score's own
 * words, and this alias's engraving lost its final `я` off the end (N.111,
 * 2026-09-04), so that queue is one slot shorter than the poem's.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK ITSELF IS NOT THE DEFECT and stays. N.111 added it so the hand
 * works on a lyric-bearing score the singer has typed no poem for, and
 * `slotQueue`'s own comment already says the singer's text wins wherever they
 * have typed any (N.10, E.31 Path C). What was wrong is the TEST: `slotQueue`
 * asks whether the poem has been TRANSCRIBED, and this asks whether text is
 * PRESENT, which is the question Dann's ruling names.
 *
 * `none` IS NOT `score`. Text is present and the transcription has not run,
 * which at boot means the dictionary has not landed. Rebuilding from the
 * score's words there is exactly the defect; rebuilding from an empty queue
 * would erase every placement. Doing nothing leaves them standing and the
 * singer presses again.
