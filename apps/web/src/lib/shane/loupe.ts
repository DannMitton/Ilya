/* ── HOW FAR BEYOND THE STAFF A TAP STILL COUNTS ─────────────────────────
   Dann's walk on `893ccb4` found the page's tap band unbounded vertically: a
   click an inch below the staff still raised the loupe, because the search
   took the nearest hit rectangle's centre with no limit on how far away that
   was. Ruled: a tap must land on or near the staff to count, bounded in
   STAVE-SPACES and not pixels so it holds at every zoom.

   FINE POINTERS GET TWO LEDGER LINES' WORTH, plus the half-space a notehead
   sitting on the second of them occupies: 2.5 spaces beyond the staff. That is
   not only the ruling's own figure, it is this document's: MEASURED for §14,
   the highest ink on the page stands 13.88 units above the staff's top line
   against a 5.5-unit space, which is 2.52 spaces. So the band covers every
   note the engraving actually draws and little else.

   COARSE POINTERS GET SEVEN, and the number is the thumb's, not the music's.
   MEASURED on the portrait thumbnail, one stave-space is 2.57 px and the
   renderer's own hit rectangle is 28.3 px tall — well under the 44 px floor
   this project holds for touch. Clearing 44 needs 17.1 spaces of total band,
   so seven beyond the staff gives 18 spaces, 46.3 px, and clears it. GEOMETRY
   ANSWERS MODALITY (principle 7): the same staff, read twice.

   WHAT THIS COSTS, said plainly: on the portrait thumbnail the systems are
   pitched 49 px apart, so bands 46.3 px tall very nearly meet, and between two
   systems a tap picks whichever staff is nearer rather than nothing. The band
   still ends: taps in the title, in the margins, beside the page and below the
   last system now do nothing, which is the defect that was reported. */

 * THE DISCRIMINATOR: where the head's ink stops and the music's begins.
 *
 * The head is the clef and the key signature, ruled by Dann 2026-08-27, and it
 * ends where the music's first ink begins. Naming that boundary is the whole
 * of the rule, and it is done here rather than in the component so there is
 * one place to read it.
 *
 * IT IS PAINT ORDER, GATED BY A HANDLE. The renderer emits a system in one
 * fixed order: the staff lines, the clef (`staff-renderer.ts:1034`), the
 * octave `8` (`:1058`), the key signature (`:1077`), and only then the tacet
 * pass (`:1214`), the note loop (`:1360`) and the underlay (`:1778`). So
 * everything before the FIRST element carrying a music handle is the head's
 * furniture, and everything from it onward is not.
 *
 * `MUSIC_MARK` IS THAT GATE. Three handles, and the renderer puts them on
 * every drawn part of a note and on nothing else:
 *
 * - `[data-event-id] > :not([data-hit])`, a notehead with its stem, flag and
 *   ledger lines (`:1467`). The group itself is deliberately not matched: its
 *   own box contains the hit rectangle.
 * - `[data-of-event]`, a part drawn OUTSIDE that group because it precedes the
 *   group in paint order: an accidental (`:1383`) or an augmentation dot
 *   (`:1444`). An accidental sits LEFT of its notehead, and MEASURED on the
 *   engraved Without Sun song 1 it is the leftmost music ink on two of the
 *   seven systems, at x = 66.38 against a notehead at 72.5.
 * - `[data-tacet]`, N.104's consolidated multibar rest (`:1214-1340`).
 *
 * WHY A GATE AND NOT A LIST. The underlay carries no handle at all
 * (`:1778`, `:1783`), and it is drawn wider than the note it sits under: on
 * six of the seven systems the first syllable begins LEFT of the first
 * notehead. A head bounded on the marked music alone paints that syllable,
 * which is a word where a clef and key belong. Paint order catches it without
 * asking the renderer for a new handle, because the underlay is emitted last.
 *
 * WHAT THE HEAD KEEPS. Anything the renderer draws before the gate and leaves
 * unmarked lands INSIDE the head. That is the right side for a clef, a key
 * signature and the octave `8`, and it would be the right side for a printed
 * time signature. **Ilya draws no time signature anywhere today**: `:964`
 * reads `timeSignature` for spacing and nothing emits it.

 * RECTANGLE of the held measure, which the renderer tiles from the midpoint
 * BEFORE each note (`staff-renderer.ts:1011`). The loupe draws the two crops
 * flush, at one scale, so any x they both contain is painted twice.
 *
 * THEY WERE THE SAME NUMBER BY CONSTRUCTION UNTIL 2026-08-29. The head was
 * bounded on `Math.min(...allHits)` then, which is the same quantity this
 * window opens on, so an overlap was impossible and the coupling was never
 * written down. `510a280` moved the head onto the music's ink to stop it
 * cutting the key signature, and broke the coupling without noticing.
 *
 * WHAT DANN WALKED, 2026-09-01. On a measure that OPENS a system the leftmost
 * hit rectangle stands at x = 56, LEFT of the key signature's second sharp,
 * whose ink runs 56.01 to 61.25; the head now runs to 63.53 or beyond. So the
 * head drew that sharp and the window drew it again, and the loupe showed
 * three sharps in a key signature that has two. MEASURED on all six affected
 * measures of the engraved Without Sun song 1: overlaps of 7.53, 8.98, 10.38,
 * 13.33, 14.77 and 13.14 units, with exactly one glyph inside each.
 *
 * NOTHING IS LOST, AND THAT IS A PROOF RATHER THAN A HOPE. The head paints
 * `[0, head]` and the clipped window paints `[head, right]`, so their union is
 * `[0, right]`, which is exactly the union the unclipped pair painted. The clip
 * changes the PARTITION and not the coverage, so it cannot remove a note, an
 * accidental, a rest or a syllable whatever the discarded region holds. A mark
 * that straddles the seam is cut by the head's crop and resumes at the window's,
 * and the two halves abut because the caller draws the crops adjacent at one
 * scale: MEASURED, the five staff lines cross it on every system and read as
 * one stave.
 *
 * THE CLAMP CANNOT BITE TODAY and is kept for the same reason `measureWindow`
 * keeps its own `left + 1`: a window narrower than a unit is not a window. A
 * head past the held measure's right edge would need a system whose first
