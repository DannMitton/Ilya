  N.55b R4: Finale's Lyrics window, in Ilya's drawer.

  Updated 2026-08-14 to the shape RULED by Dann, 2026-08-13 (STATE.md,
  "N.55b's station shape"): the lyric runs as ONE piece of readable text,
  hyphenated at slot boundaries, not a wrapped grid of chips. No IPA row —
  the station reorients you in the poem as source text; IPA reappears under
  the note once the correspondence exists. One moving highlight marks the
  cursor. The whole verse is present; this component sets no height and no
  overflow of its own, so the drawer's own scroll (`Drawer.svelte`'s
  `.drawer-content`) carries it and there is never a second, nested scroll.
  The 44 px touch floor sits on the cursor alone, not on every syllable;
  direct tapping of any syllable stays available regardless of its size.

  Finale puts the text in one window and the notes in another: you place the
  cursor at a syllable, then click notes in the score. Neither gesture is
  overloaded and there is no mode. Transcribe is the Lyrics window, but it is
  a separate tab, so the CURSOR needs a home on the score surface. It lives
  here, because drawer manipulates and page displays and prints (E.27's
  binding paradigm, which Fable lists among the rulings that may not be
  re-decided). A strip beside the stave would put a control on the paper.

  READ-ONLY, and that is not a shortcut: Transcribe owns every text
  operation. This shows the syllables and where you are in them. It never
  edits one.

  NOTHING IS CONSUMED. Placing a syllable does not remove it from the queue,
  exactly as Finale's Lyrics window keeps its text. The queue is derived from
  the transcription on every render, so a syllable you have not placed is
  still here, and one you place twice is still here.

  N.65 SHIP B: THIS STATION HAS NO HEADER. RULED BY DANN 2026-08-21 walking
  `2238e8b`: "I'm bothered by the elements here. I think we should eliminate
  the Syllables header and make the boxed syllabified text the first element
  under the Shift Lyrics header followed by the 'to the End of the Lyric'
  row." So this component is the text and the drift line, rendered by
  `+page.svelte` into `ShiftLyricsControl`'s own body, and SHIFT LYRICS is
  the one header over both.

  The placed count is a numeral pair rather than a sentence, so it needs no
  translation and no plural agreement. IT LEFT WITH THE HEADER: it is the
  status slot on the SHIFT LYRICS header now, on the desk's recommendation
  and Dann's ratification the same minute, which is where it sat relative to
  its own header before, so nothing moved in his eye except the word beside
  it. `+page.svelte` derives both numbers because the header is no longer
  this component's to draw.

  N.114 MOVED THIS LINE OUT OF SCORE MARKUP AND UNDER THE POEM FIELD.
  RULED BY DANN 2026-09-07 and 2026-09-09. `IntakePanel.svelte` renders it now,
  inside the Input band, under the score receipt, live whenever a score is
  present. It is still the same component and still read-only; what changed
  here is two colour values (ruling 4, below) and one new prop.

  `clipped` IS THE COLLAPSED ROW, ruling 2. In that state the whole row is one
  button that opens the line, so the syllables inside it CANNOT be buttons: a
  button inside a button is not a DOM a browser will build. They render as
  spans, the line breaks render as spaces, and the line clips to one row with
  an ellipsis. Nothing else differs, so the collapsed preview and the open line
  are the same object at two sizes, which is what the drawing calls for.

  THE 44 px FLOOR IS THE SABB'S ONLY WHERE THE SABB IS A TARGET. Open, it is a
  button and it carries the floor exactly as before. Clipped, no syllable is a
  target at all and the row itself carries the floor, so the SABB draws its
  cell without the floor. That removes a target rather than exempting one.

  THE COLOURS ARE INVERTED, N.114 ruling 4, Dann 2026-09-07: "Committed is
  black." Unplaced is tertiary ink and placed is primary ink; before this they
  were the other way round. The SABB cell is untouched.

  THE DRIFT LINE IS GONE, N.112, and with it this component's only
  translated string. It read "Text changed" and a count, ratified by Dann
  2026-08-14, and it existed because a seat could not follow its word: a
  changed poem left every seat where it was and the honest thing to do was
  say so. `text-diff.ts` and `reseat.ts` move the seats now, so the count had
  nothing left to count. `station.textChanged` is retired from `i18n.ts` in
  both languages, and `.station-drift` with it.
