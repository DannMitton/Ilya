  N.55b R4: Finale's Lyrics window, in Ilya's drawer.

  Updated 2026-08-14 to the shape RULED by Dann, 2026-08-13 (STATE.md,
  "N.55b's station shape"): the lyric runs as ONE piece of readable text,
  hyphenated at slot boundaries, not a wrapped grid of chips. No IPA row —
  the station reorients you in the poem as source text; IPA reappears under
  the note once the correspondence exists. One moving highlight marks the
  cursor. The whole verse is present; this component sets no height and no
  overflow of its own, so the drawer's own scroll (`Drawer.svelte`'s
  `.drawer-content`) carries it and there is never a second, nested scroll.
  The 44 px touch floor sits on the cursor alone, not on every syllable;
  direct tapping of any syllable stays available regardless of its size.

  Finale puts the text in one window and the notes in another: you place the
  cursor at a syllable, then click notes in the score. Neither gesture is
  overloaded and there is no mode. Transcribe is the Lyrics window, but it is
  a separate tab, so the CURSOR needs a home on the score surface. It lives
  here, because drawer manipulates and page displays and prints (E.27's
  binding paradigm, which Fable lists among the rulings that may not be
  re-decided). A strip beside the stave would put a control on the paper.

  READ-ONLY, and that is not a shortcut: Transcribe owns every text
  operation. This shows the syllables and where you are in them. It never
  edits one.

  NOTHING IS CONSUMED. Placing a syllable does not remove it from the queue,
  exactly as Finale's Lyrics window keeps its text. The queue is derived from
  the transcription on every render, so a syllable you have not placed is
  still here, and one you place twice is still here.

  N.65 SHIP B: THIS STATION HAS NO HEADER. RULED BY DANN 2026-08-21 walking
  `2238e8b`: "I'm bothered by the elements here. I think we should eliminate
  the Syllables header and make the boxed syllabified text the first element
  under the Shift Lyrics header followed by the 'to the End of the Lyric'
  row." So this component is the text and the drift line, rendered by
  `+page.svelte` into `ShiftLyricsControl`'s own body, and SHIFT LYRICS is
  the one header over both.

  The placed count is a numeral pair rather than a sentence, so it needs no
  translation and no plural agreement. IT LEFT WITH THE HEADER: it is the
  status slot on the SHIFT LYRICS header now, on the desk's recommendation
  and Dann's ratification the same minute, which is where it sat relative to
  its own header before, so nothing moved in his eye except the word beside
  it. `+page.svelte` derives both numbers because the header is no longer
  this component's to draw.

  THE DRIFT LINE STAYS HERE, WITH THE TEXT, and that is a decision the
  ruling did not make. It uses `.station-count` too, but it is not the
  counter Dann named: it reports a re-transcription against the text it sits
  under, so it belongs to the text rather than to the header.

  THE DRIFT LINE is the one string here that does need translating, and its
  wording was ratified by Dann on 2026-08-14: it agrees with `texte`, not
  with the count, so one string covers every number in both languages. It is
  drawn ONLY when the count is above zero, so it is not a mark that appears
  on everything and therefore says nothing. It is set in the same muted grey
  as the placed count and takes no alarm colour: a re-transcription is a
  thing the singer did on purpose, not a fault.
