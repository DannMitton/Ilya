	/* ── THE CORRECTION SURFACE (N.92, slices 2 to 4) ────────────────────
	   The four correction stations, in the ruled order: DURATION, PITCH,
	   ACCIDENTAL · ENTRY, LYRIC. Durations lead because N.95 measured
	   durations as the broken channel, 0 of 28 confident before re-derivation,
	   and pitch as nearly fine.

	   ONE COMPONENT, TWO CONTAINERS, which is slice 4's whole point. `variant`
	   decides only WHERE the surface sits: `dock` is the phone's fixed shell,
	   anchored to an edge; `panel` is the desktop drawer's scrolling tenant.
	   Everything above that line, every station, every label, every verb and
	   every string, is one implementation. A singer who learned the phone has
	   learned the desktop because there is only one thing to learn, and two
	   copies could not stay that way for a week.

	   THE DOCK IS A SIBLING OF THE DRAWER, NOT THE DRAWER RE-ANCHORED. The
	   drawer is a side-entering object whose anchors are ruled in E.36 §1.4,
	   and re-anchoring it to the bottom edge in portrait would move those
	   anchors and make geometry answer width. The dock keeps the drawer's
	   grammar: one bare pull pointing the way it moves, the same station
	   labels, the same 180 ms.

	   THE VERBS ARE THE SHIPPED VERBS RE-HOMED. Nothing here is new function.
	   Every one of them calls `+page.svelte`'s own handler, the same handler
	   the desktop `CorrectionControls` calls, so the phone and the desk cannot
	   drift. Three cells render DISABLED and carry no behaviour at all:
	   tuplet, Rest, and Tie are slice 3's.

	   ONE DISTINCTION, DRAWN EVERYWHERE. A verb sits in a box, because a box
	   says something happens to the score when you touch it. A navigation mark
	   is bare: the stepper arrows and the dismissal chevron carry no box,
	   because they move the singer around rather than change the music.

	   44 PX FLOOR, unconditional, on every control here. The page's own glyphs
	   are the ruled exemption and this surface takes none. -------------- */

	/* THE NOTATION FACE, AND IT IS THE PAGE'S OWN. Finale Maestro is the
	   product default for every rendering (Dann, 2026-07-12 and 2026-07-13),
	   registered as a document-wide FontFace by `notation-fonts.ts:53`, and
	   the score's glyphs are drawn from it by `staff-renderer.ts:505`. These
	   cells set the same family, so a duration on this surface and the same
	   duration on the page are one object at two sizes, which is what the
	   design handoff's own NOT ESTABLISHED note asks for.

	   THE CODEPOINTS ARE WRITTEN HERE rather than read from the package's
	   `SMUFL_CODEPOINTS`, and that duplication has a reason. The package's
	   registry (`smufl-metadata.ts:71`) carries the glyphs the RENDERER needs,
	   which is noteheads, flags, and stems drawn separately; it carries no
	   combined duration glyph, because a staff never draws one. Adding five
	   entries to `REQUIRED_GLYPHS` changes what `prepareSmuflFont` validates
	   and reaches gate 5, and slice 3 needs those glyphs' METRICS rather than
	   only their characters, so that is where it belongs. Finale Maestro
	   carries all five (`FinaleMaestro.json`, `glyphBBoxes`).

	   THE WORD IS THE NAME, the shipped `CorrectionControls` discipline: the
	   glyph is `aria-hidden` and a screen reader hears "Eighth", never a
	   codepoint. Where the font has not loaded, the word is drawn instead, so
	   nobody ever meets a row of empty boxes. */

	/* ── CENTRING THE GLYPH, NOT THE CHARACTER ───────────────────────────
	   Dann, 2026-08-26, at the walk: the noteheads look centred and the notes
	   do not, and the margin inside the cell is not consistent.

	   HE IS DESCRIBING SMuFL'S ORIGIN. A duration glyph's origin is its
	   NOTEHEAD, and the stem and flag run out of the character's advance
	   width, so a row of characters laid out as text lines up the noteheads
	   and leaves every note hanging off its own centre by a different amount.
	   A whole note, which has no stem at all, is the only one that looks
	   right.

	   SO THE INK IS MEASURED AND THE INK IS CENTRED. Each glyph is drawn once
	   into a hidden SVG, `getBBox` gives its real inked box, and every glyph in
	   a set is then drawn through a viewBox of one size with its own ink
	   centred inside it. One box for the set gives one scale for the set, so a
	   whole note does not swell to the height of a sixteenth, and one box size
	   gives the same margin inside every cell of that row.

	   THREE SETS, NOT ONE, because they are three different sizes of thing: a
	   sharp is not as tall as a sixteenth and an augmentation dot is not as
	   tall as either. Each set is internally consistent, which is what the eye
	   reads along a row.

	   MEASURED RATHER THAN DECLARED. The numbers could be read out of
	   `FinaleMaestro.json`'s `glyphBBoxes` instead, and then they would be
	   right for exactly one face and cost a second parse of a 386 KB file on a
	   phone. Measuring what the browser actually drew is right for whichever
	   face is loaded, including the day someone chooses Bravura or Leland.

	   THE MEASUREMENT IS CANVAS, NOT `getBBox`, and that is a correction rather
	   than a preference. `getBBox` on an SVG `<text>` returns its LAYOUT box,
	   which is the advance width by the font's own ascent and descent: every
	   one of these nine glyphs measured 402 units tall at 100 px, which is the
	   em box and not the note. `measureText`'s `actualBoundingBox*` are the
	   inked bounds, and they are relative to the same origin and the same
	   baseline that `<text x="0" y="0">` uses, so the numbers carry across
	   without conversion. Measured through it, `noteQuarterUp` runs from 88.9
	   above the baseline to 13.2 below: the notehead sits AT the origin and the
	   stem is all of the rest, which is exactly the offset Dann saw. */

	   IT JOINS THE NOTES' OWN SET, which is the whole fix: one common box means
	   one scale, so the augmentation dot is drawn at the size it has beside a
	   notehead rather than at a size chosen to make it easy to see. It had its
	   own set and its own target height, 10 px against the notes' 26, which is

	   seconds into an iOS Safari session that carries no fresh decline
	   (N.105), and at any lower value it lands on top of the LYRIC station
