/**
 * pairings.ts
 *
 * N.55b: the pairing layer. A sparse correction map from score EVENT ID to
 * what the singer decided that note carries.
 *
 * WHY A CORRECTION LAYER AND NOT A FIELD ON ParsedScore. `types.ts:470-479`
 * in score-parser says melismas are encoded by the ABSENCE of a syllable,
 * so the parsed score has two states and N.55b needs three. The third has
 * nowhere to live there. (Same wall LilyPond hit: its documentation forbids
 * `_` for skipping because an underscore already means melisma.)
 *
 * WHY BY VALUE AND NOT BY REFERENCE (R6, Dann, E.47). A pairing is a record
 * of a decision, not a derivation of the engine's. There is no stable
 * syllable id in this tree and inventing one would not survive the two
 * events it would exist to survive: a re-division is not a rename, and
 * `+page.svelte:275`, `:321`, `:376` rebuild the word objects from scratch
 * on every re-transcription. So a pairing COPIES the text at the moment of
 * the click, exactly as Finale's Click Assignment transfers a syllable onto
 * a note rather than pointing at the Lyrics window.
 *
 * WHY THE VOWEL IS STORED (R8, Dann, E.47). `vowelOfSyllable` reads the
 * engine's transcription log, not the syllable's IPA string, so a pairing
 * carrying only text would print a syllable and carry no acoustic marks.
 * The glyph is an INPUT to the forecast, never its output: nothing measured
 * is stored here and recalibration still recomputes everything downstream.
 * This is a deliberate, named exception to "do not store anything derived".
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO. It never writes to `ParsedScore`, it never
 * touches `VocalLineEvent`, and it never proposes the `empty` state: for
 * Ilya to mark a note deliberately empty is a claim, and Ilya may only ever
 * leave a note undecided (Dann, E.46).

 * design says of this scope that "section 3's state is what makes this scope
 * mean anything," and the work the undecided state does here is to CATCH the
 * shifted pairing. An earlier revision of this function stopped one short of
 * the gap, which pushed a pairing into `displaced` while an empty note sat
 * beside it. That threw away a decision the singer had made, which R6 exists
 * to prevent. Opus wrote that error into the brief, 2026-08-14.
 *
 * Direction decides which way we look, because the gap can only absorb a
 * shift that travels toward it:
 *
 * - `forward` searches UP from `fromIndex + 1`. With no gap above, the range
 *   runs to the last event and this behaves exactly like `shiftToEndOfLyric`.
 * - `back` searches DOWN from `fromIndex - 1`. With no gap below, the range
 *   runs to index 0 and the pairing there falls off the front.
