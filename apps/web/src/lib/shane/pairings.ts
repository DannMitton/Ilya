/**
 * pairings.ts
 *
 * N.55b: the pairing layer. A sparse correction map from score EVENT ID to
 * what the singer decided that note carries.
 *
 * WHY A CORRECTION LAYER AND NOT A FIELD ON ParsedScore. `types.ts:470-479`
 * in score-parser says melismas are encoded by the ABSENCE of a syllable,
 * so the parsed score has two states and N.55b needs three. The third has
 * nowhere to live there. (Same wall LilyPond hit: its documentation forbids
 * `_` for skipping because an underscore already means melisma.)
 *
 * WHY BY VALUE AND NOT BY REFERENCE (R6, Dann, E.47). A pairing is a record
 * of a decision, not a derivation of the engine's. There is no stable
 * syllable id in this tree and inventing one would not survive the two
 * events it would exist to survive: a re-division is not a rename, and
 * `+page.svelte:275`, `:321`, `:376` rebuild the word objects from scratch
 * on every re-transcription. So a pairing COPIES the text at the moment of
 * the click, exactly as Finale's Click Assignment transfers a syllable onto
 * a note rather than pointing at the Lyrics window.
 *
 * WHY THE VOWEL IS STORED (R8, Dann, E.47). `vowelOfSyllable` reads the
 * engine's transcription log, not the syllable's IPA string, so a pairing
 * carrying only text would print a syllable and carry no acoustic marks.
 * The glyph is an INPUT to the forecast, never its output: nothing measured
 * is stored here and recalibration still recomputes everything downstream.
 * This is a deliberate, named exception to "do not store anything derived".
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO. It never writes to `ParsedScore`, it never
 * touches `VocalLineEvent`, and it never proposes the `empty` state: for
 * Ilya to mark a note deliberately empty is a claim, and Ilya may only ever
 * leave a note undecided (Dann, E.46).

/**
 * The notes the singer's own edit emptied, which draw nothing on either line.
 *
 * **RIDER 0, RULED BY DANN 2026-09-07:** *"it draws nothing, because the singer
 * removed the word."* A vacated note drew the engraved file's old word
 * (`memo-n112-text-authoritative_r1_2026-09-07.md` §8), because the renderer
 * falls through to `ev.syllable?.text` for any event the preview does not name.
 *
 * **IT WAS `vacatedTail` UNTIL N.113a, AND THE TAIL WAS NEVER THE WHOLE OF
 * IT.** Two things forced the widening, both from Dann's walk of `e1bcb67`:
 *
 * 1. **His deletion ruling.** A deletion now vacates its own notes and moves
 *    nothing else (`reseat.ts`), so a vacated note is usually in the MIDDLE of
 *    the seated run rather than past the end of it. The old function looked
 *    only past the last seat and would have found nothing to blank at all.
 * 2. **The defect he walked.** With a melisma having pushed one syllable off
 *    the end, deleting `много` left the last note reading `ка ка` on both
 *    lines. The gate is `queueExhausted`, the displaced syllable left one slot
 *    unplaced, so the gate read false and the vacated notes kept the file's
 *    words. A pending displacement must not be able to make the gate lie about
 *    a note inside the run.
 *
 * **SO THERE ARE TWO REGIONS, and only one of them is gated.**
 *
 * - **INSIDE the run**, between the first seated note and the last, an
 *   undecided note is vacated ALWAYS, with no gate at all. That is Dann's own
 *   ruling of 2026-09-04, on the `ка ка` close he walked then: inside a seated
 *   run an undecided note draws nothing and must not draw the file's stale
 *   cell. Nothing can be waiting to fill it, because the run has already
 *   passed it.
 * - **OUTSIDE the run**, before the first seat or after the last, an undecided
 *   note is vacated only when the queue is exhausted. **That gate is a DESK
 *   DEFAULT of 2026-09-07 and it stands unchanged.** With slots still
 *   unplaced, a note past the last seat is one the hand has not reached, and
 *   blanking it would take away the file's words while the singer is still
 *   working from them, which is the affordance N.111's hand relies on.
 *
 * The alternative considered and NOT taken, twice now: blank every bare note
 * unconditionally. It fixes the same walk and breaks the hand.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT COVERED, and it is named rather than hidden: with a
 * melisma having displaced a slot, deleting the poem's FIRST word leaves the
 * head notes outside the run with the gate shut, so they keep the file's
 * words. Closing that needs a gate that can tell a seat the singer SPENT from
 * one that is waiting, and no derived value can see the difference.

 * and its word position from `ev.syllable?.type`, which is the FILE's own
 * division. The two agree only while every seat sits where the publisher's

 * the `start` of the syllable the file had engraved there, the extender loop
 * skipped it, and the hyphen loop drew a raised dash under the sustained note.
 * A hyphen says the word continues. It had ended.
 *
 * THE WORD IS THE KEY, and it is three fields rather than two.

 * them.
 *
 * `slotIndex` IS THE ORDINAL WITHIN THE WORD, which is what makes this a count
 * rather than a guess: the first slot opens the word, the last closes it, and a
