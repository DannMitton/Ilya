<!--
	ScoreUploader — the Fit ingest widget (Round 9 §2 Items 1, 2, 6; handover
	v35 §E.5). One drag-and-drop surface with click-to-browse, auto-detection,
	provenance-driven fidelity treatment, and inline persistent errors keyed by
	IngestError code. Agentless throughout: the copy never speaks as an agent,
	IPA and analysis live elsewhere.

	This component owns both converter lifecycles (§B.2): it constructs a
	WorkerScoreReader (denigma, .musx) and a WebmscoreMsczConverter (webmscore,
	.mscz) lazily on first need and disposes them on destroy. Each is
	constructed only when a file of its own kind actually arrives: the webmscore
	converter's warm-up prefetches ~17.5 MB of runtime assets, and the denigma
	reader's pulls a 4,511,746-byte WASM artifact (1,039,849 gzipped, measured
	2026-08-10). N.26 gave the reader the same treatment the converter always
	had; before it, a drop of any kind paid for denigma. The parsed result is
	handed up through
	`oningested`; live wiring (§E.7) consumes it. MIDI is not read and is no
	longer offered: N.58 closed on 2026-08-19 by dropping it.

	N.108 INCREMENT 2. THIS COMPONENT NO LONGER HAS A FIELD OF ITS OWN, and
	that is the whole of the change. The drawer has ONE intake now, drawn by
	`RootPanel.svelte`, and it is the surface a singer pastes into, types into,
	drops onto, and picks a file with. So the dropzone, its watermark, its
	placeholder, its format list, its scan icon and its hidden file input are
	gone from this file, and with them `browse`, `onPick`, `onDrop`,
	`onDragOver`, `onDragLeave`, `dragging`, and N.70's `acceptList`. The
	ruling in `acceptList` IS NOT SPENT: it moved with the picker it governs,
	and `RootPanel` carries it with its reasons.

	WHAT IS LEFT IS THE ENGINE AND EVERY ANSWER IT GIVES. The two converter
	lifecycles, the page reader, the clef-and-key prompt, the busy labels, the
	fidelity banner, the read report, and `classify`'s twenty-odd named errors
	are untouched, line for line. They render UNDER the one field, because
	`+page.svelte` renders this component inside the intake, which is where a
	question about a file the singer just dropped belongs.

	THE INTAKE HANDS FILES IN THROUGH `take()`, exported as an instance method
	and called from `+page.svelte` on the `bind:this`. It is `handleFile` with
	one thing in front of it: the PDF question below.

	THE ONE KIND THE BYTES CANNOT SETTLE IS A PDF, so it is the one kind that
	asks. Ruled by the build brief: "A PDF asks once, in place, which it is. Do
	not guess." Every other format the sniff meets answers for itself: MusicXML,
	MNX, the three ZIP containers and a photograph are all the SCORE, and text
	typed or pasted is the POEM. A PDF is honestly either, so `askKind` puts the
	question where the file landed and takes the singer's answer. The score
	answer is the path this component always took. The poem answer is
	`extractPdfText`, and it hands the words up through `onpoem`.

	     sentence, the scan icon, the format list, and the hidden file input.
	     Every one of them has a successor in `RootPanel`'s field, and the two
	     rulings they carried are recorded at the top of this file.

	<!-- THE OLDER-FINALE DISCLOSURE IS GONE. Dann's ruling, 2026-08-20 on his
	     walk: "Let's eliminate the 'have an older Finale file' subsection. It
	     is useless. That will let the button row beneath it snug up to the
	     input like the buttons and input field above it."

	     IT WAS REDUNDANT, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS NOT A LOSS. Dropping a `.mus`
	     file already returns `upload.err.mus`, which carries the same two
	     live options: resave as `.musx` in Finale 2014 or later, or export to
	     MusicXML. Its third option was "print to PDF and upload the PDF (PDF
	     import is coming soon)", and PDF import has since shipped, so PDF is
	     named in the drop zone's own sentence. That path is untouched:
	     `format-detection.ts` still returns `pre-2014-finale` for a `.mus`
	     and `:421` above still renders `upload.err.mus`.

	     The trial-version line is the only sentence with no other home, and
	     it went with the block rather than being rehoused unasked. -->

	   deleted with the markup they dressed. Svelte scopes a rule to the file
	   that writes the markup, and the markup is `RootPanel`'s field now.

	   THREE OF DANN'S RULINGS WERE DECLARED IN THEM, and here is where each
	   went:
	   - The placeholder top left, at the field size, in the textarea's exact
	     treatment (2026-08-20 and 2026-08-21, asked four times): the one field
	     IS the textarea, so the treatment is the textarea's by construction and
	     no second box has to be made to look like it.
	   - Three quarters of 152px (2026-08-20): there is no second box to size.
	     The one field keeps `.text-input`'s own `calc(6.75em + 13.5px)`, which
	     is the same ruling applied to the field that survived.
	   - Lavender names the score intake and sage names the text intake
	     (2026-07-13, ratified since): SPENT, not reversed. Hue names place, and
	     there is one place. The one field takes the neutral dashed frame Design
	     drew for it in the r2 prototype at `:190`; the memo says so and it is
	     Dann's to rule on the walk.
