 *
 * N.111: a vowelless clitic seated alone under a sung pitch.
 *
 * THE RULE, Dann 2026-09-03: "No vowelless word in Russian can carry a pitch
 * duration on its own. All vowelless clitics concatenate to their parent
 * syllables." Bar 8 of Musorgsky's *Without Sun* no. 1 is the case that
 * numbered the item: the printed score seats «в бью» together on one quarter,
 * and the engraved MusicXML seats «в» alone on it, because Finale needs a note
 * per syllable. Every syllable from there to the end of the piece is then one
 * note late, and until this file existed a singer had no way to say so.
 *
 * THE METHOD IS DANN'S, and it is why nothing here is a new phonological
 * predicate: the score's own words go back through the transcription pipeline
 * before placement, and the pipeline's slots are what get seated. The pipeline
 * already fuses a vowelless clitic into its host (`pipeline.ts:919-943` and
 * `:960-976`, mirrored by `buildSlotQueue` in `pairings.ts`), so the
 * seat is not a new rule; it is the existing rule reaching the path a score
 * that ARRIVES WITH WORDS takes. `isVowellessClitic` and the engine's clitic
 * tables are the only sources of "vowelless clitic" consulted here.
 *
 * ILYA SEATS AUTOMATICALLY, AT INGEST. RULED BY DANN 2026-09-04 on his walk of
 * `7875892`, amending brief r2 §5.3 and the increment 2 build: *"I swear to
 * you: no vowelless word in Russian can carry its own duration. You are
 * complicating things for the user with a situation that is impossible in
 * music notation."* There is no proposal and no button. A lone vowelless
 * clitic cannot exist on the page, so nothing asks whether it may be repaired.
 * E.24 §6's limit survives in the only form that still means anything: the
 * Corrections station STATES what Ilya did, in one sentence, with Undo, and
 * asks nothing.
 *
 * THE LIMIT STANDS, and it is the other half of the same ruling. This acts on
 * ONE divergence class. Everything else the comparison finds (a count that
 * differs for another reason, a composer setting several syllables on one
 * duration, an engraver's hyphenation Ilya does not share) is withheld exactly
 * as `vowel-resolver.ts` withholds it today (E.24 §7), and nothing is seated
 * there. Dann's words, 2026-09-04: *"I like your distinction, especially when
 * we expand Ilya to process Italian text where multiple syllables on a single
 * duration are common."* One-vowel-per-note is not built.
 *
 * IT WRITES NO `empty` AND NO `melisma` PAIRING (E.46). A note the run cannot
 * reach stays UNDECIDED, and `blanked` names it so the renderer can draw
 * nothing there rather than the file's stale cell.

 *    no vowel. A vowel-bearing proclitic on its own note (на, за) fails here,
 *    which is the negative control this item is pinned against.
 * 2. The pipeline marks the word `isVowellessClitic`, which `pipeline.ts:927`
 *    and `:972` set only inside the proclitic and enclitic branches, off the
 *    engine's own tables. No predicate is hand-rolled.
 * 3. The direction is the table's, not a guess: `isProclitic` sends the clitic
 *    forward onto the next word's first slot, `isEnclitic` back onto the
 *    previous word's last slot.
 * 4. The queue actually fused it there. Where it did not, the two sides do not
 *    agree about this word and nothing is proposed.
 * 5. The file and the queue agreed up to this word (offset zero before it, one
 *    after). A region already diverged for another reason is the withheld
 *    class, and re-seating inside it would be a guess.
