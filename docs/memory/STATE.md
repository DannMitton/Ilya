# STATE — where we are

**Rewritten clean at the close of E.48, 2026-08-13. Again at E.51, 2026-08-15.
Again at E.52, 2026-08-16.** Updated at the close of every session. This is the
only file that changes often, and it is the handover.

Repository: branch `Shane`, HEAD **`6c0c719`** at the close of E.55, the commit
carrying N.67 step 3. **Ask Dann for the state in one line. You do not run
git.**

```
git -C ~/Desktop/ilya-rewrite --no-pager log -1 --format="%H %cI" && git -C ~/Desktop/ilya-rewrite --no-pager status --porcelain
```

**E.55 shipped step 3 of N.67, the merge rule, and Dann walked it. N.68 IS
CLOSED.** An upload never destroys placements; only the singer does, on purpose.

## THE ONE THING

> **N.67 step 4, the library door.** Design
> `docs/sessions/e52-fable-save-design_r1_2026-08-16.md` §7 step 4: the song
> list, New song, rename, delete with confirmation, auto-naming per §2.3 layer
> 3, and the fingerprint recognition prompt on a neutral upload.
>
> **The walk's findings are cleared.** Dann ruled they came first, per the
> schema; N.70 and N.71 are both closed and both walked by him.
>
> **Observable:** two songs, switched between, both intact across a reload.
>
> Steps 0 through 3 are DONE. Steps 5 (the binder, N.28's door) and 6 (the
> sweep, where N.27 lands) follow.

## THE TRACKER

**The goal: a working beta. PDF, photograph, and MIDI stay in it.**

Marks: `[x]` closed · `[ ]` open · `[D]` Dann's to rule · `[~]` parked

### The blocking set: THREE

| | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| `[ ]` | **N.67** the save function | **FIRST, by Dann's ruling 2026-08-16.** Designed in full by Fable, E.52. Seven steps, 0 through 6. **Steps 0, 1, 2, and 3 CLOSED**, all observed in a real browser, step 3 walked by Dann. **Three left: 4 the library door, 5 the binder, 6 the sweep.** See the four documents below |
| `[ ]` | **N.58** MIDI import | **"cheap" does not hold. Real scope NOT ESTABLISHED.** A scoping brief for a fresh Sonnet session was written and delivered to Dann 2026-08-14. **Whether he has run it is unknown. Ask before writing a second one** |
| `[ ]` | **N.59** the reader in the browser | **Pyodide, not a rewrite. PIN THE VERSIONS.** Stand the eleven-module reader up under Pyodide with cv2 4.9.0 / numpy 1.26.4; replace `rest_templates.py`'s Node-and-Verovio shell-out with Verovio WASM; swap `reader.py:269-278`'s five-line staff heuristic for Dann's brace rule. Measured floor 2.9s load, 0.867s per page. Spike at `~/Downloads/ilya-reader-spike.html`. `claude/e43-n59-the-reader-in-a-browser_2026-08-12.md` |

### Closed and parked

| | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | **N.70** the iPhone cannot load a score | **CLOSED 2026-08-16, `58f982c`, WALKED BY DANN ON HIS OWN IPHONE.** iOS matches `accept` by registered type and knows none of `.musicxml`, `.mnx`, `.musx`, `.mscz`, so it greyed out every format Ilya reads while leaving PDFs and photos selectable. **Dann's fix, better than either option offered: filtered list on desktop, no `accept` at all on mobile** (`ScoreUploader.svelte`, `acceptList`). Measured: attribute present at 1400 px, absent below 768. **What Dann saw:** the file that was grey at 03:08 was black and selectable at 03:52, as was an unrecognised `.com` file in the same folder |
| `[x]` | **N.71** the note click | **CLOSED 2026-08-16, `58f982c`, WALKED BY DANN.** The notehead glyph was painted over its own `[data-hit]` rectangle and still interactive, so a click on the note died; every `<g data-event-id>` is now `pointer-events="none"` and the rectangle takes clicks back with its own `all`, plus `cursor="pointer"`. **What Dann saw:** a click DEAD CENTRE on the first notehead, the exact spot that did nothing an hour earlier, gave `4 / 5` with бил under it. Two tests pin both halves |
| `[x]` | **N.68** the upload that erases placements | **CLOSED 2026-08-16, `6c0c719`, WALKED BY DANN on the real deploy.** Absorbed into N.67 and fixed by architecture, not patched: `mergeOnUpload` (`pairings.ts`) keeps the map by positional key, runs `firstPass` only into an empty map, reports orphans, and never rebuilds. **What Dann saw:** he moved бил onto the first note (5/5 to 4/5, Я turned black), re-uploaded the same score, and the counter stayed 4/5 with бил still on the first note. Positive control run first: the old code snapped back to 5/5 |
| `[x]` | **N.55b** Click Assignment | **DONE AGAIN 2026-08-16, and the history is kept on purpose: it was marked DONE 2026-08-13 while its central gesture was broken**, and it stayed that way until Dann walked it 2026-08-16: clicking a notehead did nothing, because the glyph was painted over its own hit rectangle and still interactive. **Dann's ruling: the tracker should be right rather than tidy.** Repaired and closed as N.71, walked by Dann. Rotate syllables PARKED 2026-08-14 |
| `[~]` | **N.56** draw the withheld page badly | PARKED 2026-08-14, Dann's ruling |
| `[x]` | **N.32** the Guide's false claims | DONE, shipped and observed 2026-08-14 |
| `[x]` | **N.55a** the score with no underlay | Closed 2026-08-13 |
| `[x]` | **N.47** print, from a phone, once | CLOSED 2026-08-15 |
| `[x]` | **N.69** print takes the paper | CLOSED 2026-08-15, six passes, observed on paper |

### The visible list. Built only if a day finishes early

**N.62** · **N.63** · **N.45's remainder** · the **French colon spacing** (eight
sites, mechanical) · **N.51** · **N.17** · **N.19** · **N.61** · **N.6**.
**N.27 now has a home:** Fable's step 6 routes `profileStore.saveStore` through
the library module's reporting seam. **N.28** ships on N.67's step 5 binder.

---

## N.67. THE FOUR DOCUMENTS, ALL IN THE REPOSITORY

**They are in `docs/sessions/`, not in project knowledge. Read the design first;
the other three are context.**

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `e52-fable-save-design_r1_2026-08-16.md` | **The design.** Architecture, what a saved song is, migration, failure handling, the binder, the weight, the build order, the copyright answer |
| `e52-fable-save-socket_r1_2026-08-16.md` | **The seam.** Options compared, the recommendation, multi-tab, and step 0 |
| `e52-fable-save-retention_r1_2026-08-16.md` | **File handling.** What is kept per input kind, and at what fidelity |
| `e52-brief-to-fable_r1_2026-08-16.md` | The brief they answer. Its §3 is a verified inventory of the tree as of `fd1f628` |

**The headline, so a session knows what it is walking into.** A saved song is
everything the singer supplied for one piece under one permanent random id, in a
new IndexedDB database **`ilya-library`**, separate from `loader.ts`'s
**`ilya-data`** because that one is pinned at version 1 and upgrading it would
break the dictionary. Continuous save, no button. Every failure visible. Export
is a `.ilya` **binder**, a ZIP built by promoting the tree's own test-fixture ZIP
builder, so **zero new dependencies and about 8 KB of bundle.** Uploads merge by
the positional event ids; only an explicit *Start placement over* rebuilds.

**Fable's recommended socket:** a rune-bearing `SongDocument` class in
`lib/library/document.svelte.ts`. **Built, E.53.** The restore race documented
at the old `+page.svelte:94-99` is impossible by construction and its guard flag
is deleted, not moved.

**Multi-tab:** `BroadcastChannel('ilya-library')` after each committed write. A
clean tab reloads, a dirty tab keeps the singer's work and shows one notice.

### Three corrections to the addendum, measured E.53

- **§7.1 is settled, and it split in two.** A `.svelte.ts` rune module compiles,
  type-checks, and builds with **no configuration work**. But **§5 is wrong that
  `flushSync` drives its effects in a test**: runes are INERT under this vitest
  suite. See `ENVIRONMENT.md`, "Runes under vitest." All logic therefore lives in
  the plain-TS facade, and `document.svelte.ts` holds only fields, the factory,
  and the teardown.
- **§4.4's `{#if doc}` is not needed.** `+layout.ts` sets `ssr = false`, so there
  is no hydration pass. Step 0 built the document synchronously at component
  init; step 1 moved the read into `+page.ts`'s load function, which runs before
  the component exists. Either way the page never holds a `null` document.
- **§3's blast-radius numbers were `grep -c`, which counts LINES, not
  occurrences.** The real figure was 44 compiler-named references, 8 shorthand
  props, and 7 deletions, and it omitted `openSyllabification`, which its own §1
  lists as a document field.

---

## RULED IN E.54, 2026-08-16

- **`fake-indexeddb` is IN**, on Dann's condition that its registry facts be
  checked first: **6.2.5, Apache-2.0, zero runtime dependencies, 4.63 million
  weekly downloads, last published 2025-11-07.** Dev-only, zero shipped bytes.
  **His reason, which is the durable part: the five gates are what protect a
  ship, and a Playwright lane outside them protects nothing automatically.**
  Confirmed against `ilya-ship.sh:76-80`, where `test:e2e` is indeed not a gate.
- **The `storage.otherTab` French was shown to Dann before it shipped.**
  `'onglet'` and `'chant'` are adopted, ordinary words. Nothing coined.

## RULED THIS SESSION, 2026-08-16

- **N.67 goes first and displaces N.58 and N.59.** Dann. Not re-openable.
- **The retention rule, ratified verbatim by Dann.** It NARROWS his own earlier
  *store what a human supplied*, and the narrowing was named rather than
  smuggled:
  > *Store what a human supplied: notation byte for byte, and a picture as its
  > ink, in greyscale at no less than the reader's working resolution with
  > margin, with the original's name and hash recorded whether or not its bytes
  > are kept.*
- **Never binarise a stored page.** Fable overruled the coordinator here.
  Turning grey into black-and-white is the extractor's own first derivation, and
  doing it early and permanently destroys what a better reader would need. Its
  precedent is the Xerox JBIG2 substitution incident. The checkable floor is
  **greyscale, interline at least 20 px, retained near 28 to 30**, expressed in
  staff-line spacing rather than DPI so it survives different page sizes.
- **`.musx` is kept byte for byte**, not as its conversion. 64 to 146 KB is no
  weight problem, the WASM ships regardless, and storing the conversion would
  freeze the song at today's converter.
- **Conversion is silent.** No mark on the page, ever. The original's hash and
  the rendition parameters live in the record and the binder, and one sentence
  goes in the Guide.

---

## N.67 STEP 4, SPLIT BY DANN 2026-08-16

**Step 4 does not go whole and does not wait whole.**

- **4a, BUILT: the chimera warning.** Ilya can now tell that a different piece
  has arrived and says so. Where the singer proceeds, the WHOLE song is
  replaced together, title, source, and placements, so the record is coherent.
  One song at a time, honestly.
- **4b, WAITS behind N.58 and N.59: the library itself.** The list, rename,
  delete, and switching between saved songs. That is the feature, it is what
  makes songs plural, and it is not what ended the chimera.

**The trigger, decided by Claude on Dann's instruction: the fingerprint differs
AND at least one placement would be orphaned.** A corrected note keeps every
position, so nothing is orphaned and nothing is asked, which is design §2.4's
own promise kept. **A pitch-proportion test was considered and REJECTED**: a
transposed edition changes every pitch while keeping every position, and in
vocal repertoire that is a common, legitimate re-upload where placements must
survive; the rule would fire on it at nearly 100%, indistinguishable from a
different piece. **The named miss that remains:** a different piece whose rhythm
matches the old one note for note across a whole score orphans nothing and
passes silently. That shape is an artefact of small fixtures, not of repertoire.

**Does 4a break §2.6?** No, it narrows it. §2.6's rule is "an upload never
destroys placements; only the singer does, on purpose", and 4a destroys them
only on a yes, the same shape as the *Start placement over* control §2.6 already
names. **Fable's own neutral-state branch cannot be had without 4b**: it ends in
"a new song is created", which needs a second reachable record.

## WHAT A SECOND SCORE DID BEFORE 4a. Measured at `5c9c7f3`, not modelled

**Walked in a browser: score one, then a structurally different score two,
reading `ilya-library` after each.**

- **Nothing is orphaned and nothing accumulates.** One record, one source, one
  id, one `ilya:activeSongId`, before and after. Storage is clean.
- **But song one is OVERWRITTEN IN PLACE.** Its title and its stored score file
  become score two's. Its placements survive onto music they were never made
  for, and **two of five silently landed on notes of the new piece**, because
  event ids are positional. The drawer reported *"3 placements have no note in
  this score. They have been kept."* and the counter still read `5 / 5`.
- **Why: §2.6 has TWO upload branches and only one is reachable.** "Upload into
  the open song" is built (step 3). "Upload from a neutral state (no open song,
  or the singer pressed New song)" cannot occur, because there is always an open
  song and there is no New song control. **A singer has no way to say "this is a
  different piece."**
- **The design's rule holds literally**: an upload never destroys placements.
  Nothing in it protects the SONG.

**Does step 5 depend on step 4?** Partly, and the split is sharp. **Works
single-song:** export one song, and restore a one-song binder into an emptied
library, which is the eviction fire escape §8 justifies. **Needs step 4:**
"unknown song id, imported whole" while keeping the current one; "keep both",
which re-ids the incoming copy and is plural by definition; and any multi-song
binder. The binder is not blocked by step 4, but everything that makes it a
LIBRARY backup rather than a SONG backup is.

## OWED, RULED BUT NOT YET DONE

- **Step 5's export, single-song half.** Established 2026-08-16: exporting one
  song and restoring a one-song binder into an emptied library both work without
  the list. It is the only thing that would give the chimera warning a detour
  instead of a stop sign. **Dann's ruling: deferred, recorded as owed against
  step 5, NOT folded into 4a.**
- **Remove `bits-ui` from `apps/web/package.json`.** Ruled 2026-08-16: native
  `<dialog>` + `showModal()` is the answer for the delete confirmation AND the
  fingerprint prompt, not bits-ui. **Dann's ruling on timing: not in step 4's
  commit.** It costs zero bytes while nothing imports it, so removing it is
  hygiene, not weight, and it is a lockfile operation. **Do it clean, on its own.**
  Measured before the ruling: one `AlertDialog` cost **+18.7 KB gzipped**
  (392,547 to 411,292), against Fable's ~8 KB budget for all of N.67.
- ~~`InstallPrompt.svelte:83`'s false `role="dialog"`~~ **DONE 2026-08-16**,
  Dann's ruling. It is a bottom banner, not a modal, and `showModal()` would
  have trapped a singer inside an install suggestion. Now `role="region"`, which
  keeps the `aria-label` exposed where a bare div would have dropped it.

## RULINGS DANN OWES. Ask one at a time, at the right moment

- **The sage rules print faint in greyscale.** `--sage` is `#8B9A7D`
  (`app.css:33`), about 58% relative luminance, and print swaps `--paper-cream`
  for pure white. Three levers: leave it; darken `--sage` globally, which keeps
  print identical to screen; or darken at print only, which breaks the WYSIWYG
  principle he set in E.51. **Nothing depends on it.**
- **Which of N.58 and N.59 is next**, once N.67 is done. E.51 recommended N.59
  and it was never ruled.
- **N.63.** Killing the interstitial is ruled; **where the honest residue goes is
  not.** Asked in E.45, still unanswered.
- **N.45's remainder.**
- **The French question mark.** Eleven strings carry U+00A0 before `?`.
- *(Not yet: what a deliberately empty note draws.)*

---

## THE SCHEMA. It has survived ten sessions

1. Only blocking work gets built.
2. **A new cardinal displaces a named one or waits. Say which.**
3. Half of every build day is reserved for what the previous day's walk found.
4. Every build day ends in a deploy and a walk.
5. N.48 may be unclosable; it needs a `[u]` that fails.

---

## THE FIXTURE. Read out of the file, do not re-derive it

`~/Downloads/no-lyrics-control.musicxml` is the only instrument that exercises
the no-underlay path; all three of Dann's own scores carry lyrics.

**It holds five pitched notes and one half rest:** C4 D4 E4 F4 quarters, G4 half,
then a half rest. **It is NOT six notes.** Its stripped lyric line was five
syllables, «Я тебя любил». **Its header title is a different text from its lyric
line.**

**The walk, four steps.** Transcribe some Russian, or the queue is empty and
nothing draws. Switch to Fit **before touching any file input.** Upload the
control, press *Continue to analysis*. **Expect `5 / 5`, syllables under the
notes, the rest bare, no dashed boxes.** Walked and confirmed 2026-08-13.

**This same walk is N.67 step 3's observation**, with the expectation stated
before the walk: re-uploading the control over placed syllables no longer erases
them.

**The print fixture, E.51.** Marshak's Russian of Shakespeare's Sonnet 90, under
Kabalevsky op. 52 no. 9, fourteen lines. **It fills exactly two letter sheets.**

---

## RULED 2026-08-16, ON E.55'S WALK FINDINGS

- **The walk's findings come before N.67 step 4**, per the schema's own rule
  that half of every build day is reserved for what the previous walk found.
- **N.70 and N.71 are numbered. The third finding, no cursor on a note, is
  FOLDED INTO N.71** rather than tracked: one CSS declaration on the same
  element as N.71's fix.
- **N.55b's row is corrected rather than left tidy**, Dann's words.
- **The N.70 fix is Dann's own third option**, better than either I posed:
  filtered on desktop, no `accept` at all on iOS. Named consequence, accepted:
  the tree's `isMobile` is a WIDTH test, so a narrow desktop window also gets
  the unfiltered picker.

## STILL UNSETTLED. Not yours to settle alone

- **Where the storage notices belong.** They render in the FIT drawer only, so a
  singer working in Transcription never sees a save failure or the two-tab
  notice. Inherited from when they were pairing notices; not moved in E.54
  because moving them is a placement decision, not a build step.
- **The three storage strings still say "syllable placements"** and the save is
  now the whole song. Design §7 puts that copy in step 6, with the French shown
  to Dann first, so it was left alone rather than rewritten twice.

- "The page carries no chrome." · "Do not introduce a slider."
- **N.51:** whether per-tab colour may propagate past the tab bar.
- Whether `claude/shane-project-map_2026-07-25.md` is stale. **Unopened for
  twelve sessions.**
- **D3's Job A**, per-verse reprints, ruled in E.36 and still unnumbered.
- **The per-format score arrival audit**, asked for in E.45 and never written.
- **`stripBackingRect` matches `fill="#FFFFFF"` while `staff-renderer.ts` paints
  `#F0EBE0`.**
- **The marks on the printed page.** E.51's prints carry a dashed `VERIFY` box
  and a `USER OVERRIDE` badge on paper. CONTRACT §6 forbids a mark that says Ilya
  is unsure. **Whether these are the ruled exception was not checked.**
- **`VoiceProfilePane.svelte:295-313` duplicates the old header arithmetic.**
  Fit's paper does not yet share the Transcribe paper's single `HEADER_GAP`.
- **Whether `.mscz` ingest actually succeeds in a browser.** The path is live in
  code (`ScoreUploader.svelte:106-137`) but `i18n.ts:272` still carries a
  "coming soon" string for it. Nobody has run it.

---

## Register corrections owed

`claude/ILYA-REGISTER_2026-08-11.md` is at revision 10 and needs revision 11.
Its N.55a row is FALSE (N.55a is CLOSED). It says "ten cardinals" over a list of
twelve; **five actually remain and none is in the tree: N.1, N.2, N.3, N.18,
N.21.** Its N.55b row is stale. **The blocking number is now THREE.**

**Or fold the register into this file and retire it.** It is the last piece of
canon still living in project knowledge.

---

## Log

| date | what changed |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-16 | **E.56: `046beec` and `58f982c`. N.71 and N.70, both found by Dann walking and both closed by Dann walking.** The notehead swallowed its own click for three days behind a DONE mark; iOS silently refused every score format Ilya can read. **Neither was reachable by a gate, and both were found by a musician using the thing.** score-parser 442 to 444. |
| 2026-08-16 | **E.55: `6c0c719`, N.67 step 3 shipped and WALKED BY DANN. N.68 closed.** `mergeOnUpload` keeps the map by positional key, proposes only into an empty map, reports orphans, and never rebuilds; *Start placement over* is the singer's own and only destructive act. Seven new tests, gates 504 to 511. |
| 2026-08-16 | **The walk was built to be able to FAIL, and that is why it is worth anything.** Re-running the first pass over an unchanged transcription produces the same layout either way, so the walk needs one deliberate change in the middle. Positive control: the old code was temporarily restored and the identical walk snapped back to 5/5; the merge rule held at 4/5. |
| 2026-08-16 | **Three defects found by Dann walking, none by a gate.** The notehead swallows its own click, notes have no cursor affordance, and no iPhone can load a `.musicxml` at all. See the section above. **The instrument lesson: my Playwright harness had to DISPATCH the note click because a real click was intercepted, and I read that as a test artifact instead of as the bug it was.** |
| 2026-08-16 | **E.54: N.67 steps 1 and 2. The vault and the source.** `ilya-library` v1 with `songs` / `sources` / `meta`; the §3 migration, write-verify-then-remove; `persist()` and `estimate()` called for the first time in this project's life (Dann's Mac reports a **1.9 GB** quota against 3.4 KB used); `BroadcastChannel` for two tabs; the score kept byte for byte and re-ingested at boot. **34 new tests, gates 470 to 504.** |
| 2026-08-16 | **TWO BUGS THAT ALL FIVE GATES PASSED, both found only in a real browser.** (1) `$state` proxies cannot be structured-cloned, so **every IndexedDB write failed** until `$state.snapshot()` was applied; localStorage never showed it because `JSON.stringify` reads a proxy happily. (2) The effect's guards were in the wrong order, so **the singer's first edit was swallowed** as though it were the load echo. Both are in `ENVIRONMENT.md`. **The lesson is the instrument: drive Playwright yourself, it is installed and it takes thirty seconds.** |
| 2026-08-16 | **E.53: `4568e01`, N.67 step 0 shipped and observed.** The song document, the facade, the legacy driver, 32 new tests. `+page.svelte` 2,095 to 2,009 lines, its per-song localStorage sites to **zero**, 1,324 lines added under `lib/library/`. **Observed in a browser on Dann's Mac, not merely written:** a seeded pairing map survived an idle reload byte for byte, which is the race the deleted guard flag existed to prevent. **web-test baseline moved 438 to 470 with Dann's permission** (`ilya-ship.sh:79`). |
| 2026-08-16 | **The rename method worth reusing.** Delete the declarations FIRST, let `svelte-check` name every surviving reference, then insert at exactly the reported `line:col` after asserting the identifier is there. The compiler cannot report a comment, a string, or an import path, so nothing else can be hit, and 0 errors at the end is the proof. 44 of 44 applied, zero mismatches. |
| 2026-08-16 | **E.52 closed. No code shipped.** N.67 ruled first, displacing both blockers. Fable commissioned three times and returned the design, the socket, and the retention policy, all in `docs/sessions/`. The retention rule ratified. **The build moves to Claude Code in the desktop app's Code tab**, folder associated; see `ENVIRONMENT.md`. |
| 2026-08-16 | **Corrections to `claude/e45-n67-storage-architecture_2026-08-13.md`, measured:** Ilya already uses IndexedDB (`loader.ts:103-115`, `ilya-data` v1, store `cache`); `.musx` does not compress, so sources are 64 to 146 KB and stay there, not 15 to 25 KB. `navigator.storage.persist()` has never been called. |
| 2026-08-16 | **A process failure worth keeping.** Half an hour was spent measuring that no gate runs on the device VM. `ENVIRONMENT.md` already said so. Its read rule is "before you touch a tool, a path, or a gate," and it was not followed. |
| 2026-08-15 | **E.51 closed. N.69 and N.47 both CLOSED.** `STATE.md` rewritten, `ENVIRONMENT.md` gained the print, Vercel, container-renderer, and measurement sections. |
| 2026-08-15 | **`8af064e`: N.69 settled.** `HEADER_GAP = 16` on both pages; `HEADER_HEIGHTS_AT_LETTER` measured in headless Chromium. Verified in a container render before Dann printed it. Dann on paper: *"the spacing is correct."* |
| 2026-08-15 | **`bd811d3`: a wrong turn, recorded.** Generalised the broken mechanism instead of the working one. Also hid `vercel-live-feedback` at print, which survives. |
| 2026-08-15 | **`3187c40`: print stops re-typesetting the page.** |
| 2026-08-15 | **Vercel SSO turned OFF for project `ilya`.** Reversible in Settings, Deployment Protection. |
| 2026-08-15 | **Asked and answered from the code, no change made: is `с` in «если» regressively palatalized by `лʲ`?** No, by two independent mechanisms (`engine.ts:295`, `:898`, `:303`, `:998-999`). The code records that Grayson p. 209 and D&P pp. 76-87 disagree and that **Ilya follows D&P**. Changing it would reverse a ruling. |
