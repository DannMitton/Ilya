# STATE — where we are

**Rewritten clean at the close of E.48, 2026-08-13. Again at E.51, 2026-08-15.
Again at E.52, 2026-08-16.** Updated at the close of every session. This is the
only file that changes often, and it is the handover.

Repository: branch `Shane`.

**THIS FILE NEVER NAMES HEAD, AND CANNOT.** The commit carrying this line cannot
name itself, which is why every previous attempt was stale within the hour and
cost a minute at the next session's open, twice.

What it names instead is a **FLOOR**: everything described below was true at or
before **`00149c3`**, "N.113a: the walk findings", shipped 2026-09-07 late,
alias `ilya-1788838744333` confirmed serving it (the previous floors, `e1bcb67`
of 2026-09-07 and earlier, are in `../sessions/LOG.md`). A floor cannot go stale,
because further commits only move HEAD forward and never make the floor false.
If the tree is ahead of it, that is expected and tells you only that work has
landed since.

**The ten superseded floors that used to be listed here, `2b81f5a` through
`2d54185`, are in `../sessions/LOG.md`, block 5.** They are closed, and closed
things do not live in this file.

**The push range is the check, not the memo.**
A floor that predates
its own content is the stale number this paragraph exists to prevent. A floor cannot go stale, because further commits only
move HEAD forward and never make the floor false. If the tree is ahead of it,
that is expected and tells you only that work has landed since.

**Ask Dann for the state in one line. You do not run git.**

## THE ONE THING

> **The history of this section moved to `../sessions/LOG.md` on 2026-09-01.**
> Every entry from 2026-08-23 to 2026-08-27 that used to sit here is in that
> file, verbatim and in order. Nothing was rewritten. This section now carries
> the current one thing and nothing else, which is what `README.md` sends you
> here for.

> **Closed and moved to `../sessions/LOG.md` block 8 at the close of the
> 2026-09-07 session:** N.108 (five increments, `2c1cecf` to `5f6a2f3`),
> N.111 (`7875892`, `c574cf8`, `d5a49ff`, `a186f20`), N.112 (`b191867`,
> `1b3054a`), and N.113 (`e1bcb67`, walked 2026-09-07). All walked by Dann.
>
> **THE TEXT-TO-SCORE SEQUENCE, RULED BY DANN 2026-09-06**, one path through
> the pairing layer: 1 N.108-5 cleanup DONE; 2 N.112 the text is
> authoritative DONE; 3 N.113 the melisma DONE; 4 N.114 Type Into Score,
> NEXT. Then N.110 (set aside, briefed), N.115, N.116, the release order
> N.85 to N.88, N.84 (Guide and Learn, deferred until N.114), N.83.
>
> **N.113a SHIPPED `00149c3`, 2026-09-07 late, WALKED BY DANN 2026-09-08 00:05, see the walk block below.**
> Code built, gated (gate 4 moved 1056 to 1058), and walked all five items on a
> local production build: memo `docs/sessions/memo-n113a-walk_r1_2026-09-07.md`.
> `ilya-ship.sh:79` now reads `1058`. **Dann's walk on the alias is the one
> open step**; the session that shipped it hit its five-hour limit at 97%
> before he opened the alias. The five things to see: a deleted word leaves
> its notes bare on both lines and moves nothing; after a melisma, a deleted
> word's notes stay bare (no `ка ка`); the dock's Melisma row carries the
> dock's 4 px gap; Cmd-Z undoes only with the field unfocused; the loupe boxes
> the taken notehead, no bar. **Memo §9 carries two findings not Code's to
> fix**: a clitic re-seat pulls a run back by one after a melisma shift
> (`seatCliticFolds` in `reseatAcross`), and on the walk fixture 59 of 96
> seats carry score coordinates, so a text edit reaches only poem lines 0, 1,
> 2, and 7. The second wants a number. **Memo §10, NOT ESTABLISHED**: the
> tail case of the vacated-note rule; a melisma displacement plus deleting the
> first word leaves head notes on the file's words (a ruling, not a default);
> Ctrl-Z on Windows and Linux.
>
> **N.113a WALKED BY DANN 2026-09-08 00:05, on the alias, ALL FIVE SEEN.**
> Items 1 and 2 together: with the melisma set, deleting «песня» left its two
> notes and the sustained B♭ bare on both lines, nothing else moved, no file
> words appeared, POEM 37 to 36 words. Redo by Shift-Cmd-Z also seen. N.113a
> is CLOSED except for the three findings below, which are N.113b's. Item 5 SEEN:
> the taken note wears the box, no bar. **Two findings, both Dann's, for a
> N.113b:** (1) the loupe's box on the taken note goes LAVENDER (it drew
> sage); (2) the loupe's locator, "m. 7 · system 3 of 8", gains a SECOND LINE
> naming the note, its beat in the measure, and its duration, in the shape of
> the drawing's "note 5, F♯4, quarter" line he liked. The tree already knows the beat:
> `RhythmicPosition` (`packages/score-parser/src/types.ts:510-518`) holds each
> note's position from the barline as a whole-note fraction, so the second
> line is formatting against the time signature, not a new measurement. **RULED BY DANN on the same walk: the beat count
> is COMPOUND-METRE AWARE.** 6/8 is two beats of a dotted quarter, not six;
> when the numerator is a multiple of 3 and the denominator 8 or 16, the beat
> is the dotted unit and the count is numerator ÷ 3; otherwise the beat is the
> denominator's unit; 3/8 is one beat. A position inside a beat reads as beat
> plus pulse, wording to be shown to Dann before it ships. Item 3 SEEN: the
> Melisma row's gap reads even. **(3) DEFECT, Dann's eye on the page 2026-09-07
> late:** Melisma on the taken B♭3 (m. 7, «песня», word-final «ня») drew a
> HYPHEN level with the other hyphens, not the baseline extender. The file's
> convention is hyphen `y=147` stroke 1, extender `y=151` stroke 0.5
> (memo-n113 §7.1); the harness walk saw an extender on «ка» (memo-n113
> §8 step 1), so this is likely the mid-run or shifted case. Rule, Dann's:
> word-final sustain draws an extender on the baseline; mid-word sustain
> keeps hyphens. Item 4 SEEN, both halves: Cmd-Z with the field focused does
> nothing; blurred, it undid the melisma and the pill read "Redo: melisma
> set". Items 1 to 4 not yet
> walked when this line was written.
>
> **N.113b SHIPPED `6ec4378`, 2026-09-08, WALK STOPPED AT ITEM 3, 2026-09-09.**
> Items 1 and 2 SEEN by Dann (lavender box; second locator line read `G3 ·
> beat 1 · Quarter`). Item 3 NOT WALKED. **Open, and the thread ended on it:**
> on Without Sun no. 1, system 1, an extender runs from «ка» of «Комнатка»
> onto the B♭3 (m. 2, beat 3, dotted quarter) and every syllable after it
> sits one note late; Dann calls it an improper melisma. The Melisma pill on
> that note is PLAIN (Dann's eye, 2026-09-09), so it is not a singer mark in
> the store. Where the extender and the shift come from is NOT ESTABLISHED;
> the desk did not open the file's own melisma path. Next session opens
> `pairings.ts` (`melismaIds`, `:408`) and the renderer's `melismaEndX` /
> `melismaPreview` (`staff-renderer.ts:2751-2759`, option at `:337`) and reads
> the score file's own underlay for that note before saying anything. Also
> ask Dann whether the setting holds «ка» across the B♭ or brings «тес»
> onto it; he knows the score. **The thread ended with Dann upset at the
> desk's untethered claims; tether 21 in `CONTRACT.md` is the ruling.**
> Memo `docs/sessions/memo-n113b-walk-findings_r1_2026-09-08.md`. Gates 4 and 5
> moved to 1074 and 547 | 5 (552), `ilya-ship.sh:79-80` updated. Item 1 SEEN
> by Dann: the loupe's box is lavender, the page ring with it (Code's
> default). **Walk finding, cosmetic:** a vertical hairline above the stave
> between the key signature and the taken note, visible at 90% browser zoom
> only, gone at other zooms. DESK INFERENCE: a rasterization seam where the
> loupe's head crop meets its music crop (`Loupe.svelte:509-517`, one clone,
> two viewports) lands on a fractional device pixel. Fix is Code's: overlap
> the crops by a fraction or snap the seam. Not a DOM element; not chased.
> **Walk observation, not a defect:** the box on a B♭3 with a flat read tall
> to Dann. Cause established: `VoiceProfilePane.svelte:459` sets height to
> `max(ink + 18, width × 2.5)`; the flat widens the box and the ruled 2.5
> portrait floor grows the height. The ring never reads the underlay. The
> desk first blamed the extender off a picture and was wrong; Dann corrected
> it. Whether 2.5 holds on accidental-bearing notes is his, unasked.
> **Memo §7.1, Code's finding, wants a number:** on the Sunless fixture with
> no poem and no melisma, the system holding measure indices 6 and 7 draws
> nine underlay cells where the file has twelve, wrong words; every other
> system right; the pairing layer's seats, third walk to touch it (see also
> memo-n113a §9). Dann to rule whether it is numbered.
>
> **N.113b ITEM 3 CLOSED BY DANN'S HANDS, 2026-09-09, session on HEAD `15e8ab4`.**
> The "improper melisma" was not a melisma path at all: the score file gives
> the B♭3 of m. 2 its own «тес» and no `<extend>` (parsed this session), the
> renderer's file-side rule (`staff-renderer.ts:1841-1852`) and singer-side
> rule (`:1887-1904`) both need the next note bare or marked, and the pill
> was plain. What the page carried was a garbled seat map: from «тес» on,
> every seat one note late, two junk seats («я ти»), «ка» unseated, the
> final «я» pushed off; system 2 carried «на нат Ком» for «на-я тень»;
> «песня» was absent because Dann deleted it on the N.113a walk. **Cleaned
> with the existing hands only:** shift ← to end of lyric from the junk
> note (drops the taken note's seat, `pairings.ts:849-850`, and pulls every
> later seat back one), then two-click placements (arm the syllable in the
> Underlay station, `SyllableStation.svelte:129`; pick the note in the loupe,
> `+page.svelte:623-626`, `:579-600`), then «песня» typed back into the poem
> box, which re-seated live with no press (N.112, `+page.svelte:544-548`)
> but produced a stray «в бью» and a one-forward shift after it, cleaned by
> one more shift ←. **Dann: the whole piece is seated.** Whether the seat
> garble's ORIGIN is the pairing layer's coordinates (memo-n113a §9, 59 of
> 96 seats) is still unnumbered and still wants a number.
>
> **Walk findings 2026-09-09, all Dann's, in INBOX.md:** the loupe's box on
> the dotted B♭3 reads tall (`VoiceProfilePane.svelte:459`); the loupe's
> locator should read "dotted quarter" not "Quarter · Dot", French to be
> shown; the Open syllables toggle should alter Score markup live as it does
> Transcription; the loupe draws a stress mark U+02C8 in a Cyrillic cell
> where the page does not (loupe only, source NOT ESTABLISHED, neither
> `pairings.ts` write of `STRESS_MARK` touches `cyrillic`); a placed final
> syllable draws no hyphen before it («ка я»; `pairedSyllableType` not
> read).
>
> **N.118, NUMBERED BY DANN 2026-09-09: punctuation travels in the slot.**
> A placed syllable never carries the poem's punctuation because
> `cyrOfSyllable` reads `cleanWord` (`pairings.ts:152-159`); the punctuated
> cells on the page are wherever the map has no entry (`pairedCyrillic`,
> `:702-712`, overrides only mapped ids; consistent with Dann's screens, not
> yet proven on a taken note). Ruled design, desk's recommendation taken
> over Dann's first idea of a Transcribe-and-fit restore pass: give the
> word's LAST syllable its trailing punctuation inside `buildSlotQueue`
> (`:192-226`), so every placement, shift, and re-seat carries it. NOT
> ESTABLISHED for Code: whether `WordStackData` holds the raw word beside
> `cleanWord`; whether `estimateCyrillicWidthPx` prices a trailing comma.
> Gould rule 10 (project extraction, snippet only): the Cyrillic line keeps
> the author's punctuation. Dann said N.115; N.115 was taken, N.118 is the
> DESK DEFAULT. After N.114 unless he places it.
>
> **N.114 DONE. SHIPPED `3765314`, WALKED BY DANN ON THE ALIAS 2026-09-09, ALL SEEN.**

> (3) COLOUR INVERTED from the tree's default: unplaced syllables in tertiary
> ink, placed in primary ink, "committed is black"; (4) his term for the
> cursor is the **syllable-assignment bounding box, SABB**; use it; (5) RULED:
> the line is click-to-place only; a click moves the SABB and does NOT park
> the field's caret (navigation conflict); the field writes, the line places,
> the dock's typed field rewrites one word, every other verb stays in the
> dock; (6) plate 4's taken-note line ("note 5, F♯4, quarter") is desk
> wording, liked, not in the tree. **Facts for the brief, read from the tree
> 2026-09-07:** syllable overrides survive Transcribe since N.112
> (`+page.svelte:2082`) but are cleared by Clear, song switch (`:2090-2096`)
> and the global open-syllabification toggle (`:2391`); they are per-session,
> never stored (`:2076`); Start placement over does not touch them (`:529`).
> Whether the line syllabifies before Transcribe is pressed is Code's cost to
> state. **"Transcribe owns every text operation" is E.46's desk comment, not
> a ruling.** Frame agreed 2026-09-07 (Dann's idea, desk-adjusted; INBOX): the syllabified line moves
> from Score markup to sit under the field inside the Input band, live on
> text present, collapsed by default; without a score it is read-only
> syllabification (hyphens, no box); with a score the box appears and a
> click moves the cursor. Score markup keeps Corrections, Voice, and a placed
> count. The loupe dock keeps the hands: taken note, next syllables, shifts,
> Undo and Redo, and N.114's typed field, which rewrites that word in the
> poem and marks it in the field; N.112 re-seats. Drawing before Code.

## THE TRACKER

**The goal: a working beta. PDF, photograph, and MIDI stay in it.**

Marks: `[x]` closed · `[ ]` open · `[D]` Dann's to rule · `[~]` parked

### THE BLOCKING SET IS EMPTY, 2026-08-21

**Was THREE until 2026-08-18, then TWO, and on 2026-08-21 it emptied.** N.59
left it by being answered rather than finished. N.67 closed 2026-08-18. N.72
closed 2026-08-21 on Dann's own iPhone. **N.58 was DEFERRED TO FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT by Dann, 2026-08-21.** Nothing blocks the beta.

| | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | **N.67** the save function | **CLOSED WHOLE 2026-08-18.** This row read `[ ]` until 2026-08-21, when the desk found it contradicting the section above that records every step walked by Dann on a deploy. **The tracker was stale, not the work.** |
| | *(2026-08-18 detail, kept)* | **FIRST, by Dann's ruling 2026-08-16.** Designed in full by Fable, E.52. Seven steps, 0 through 6. **ALL SEVEN ARE NOW SHIPPED.** Steps 0 through 5 are CLOSED and every one of them was walked by Dann on a deploy; step 5 shipped `9892887`, was walked on `ilya-eaxv09qx3` (`a8a979b`) in twelve steps, record `docs/sessions/n67-5-dann-walk_r1_2026-08-18.md`. **The emergency is over and songs are plural.** **STEP 6 SHIPPED `cee4572` 2026-08-18, memo in the same commit, and Code walked all eight items of its brief on a local production build, refuting its own build three times.** Gate 4 moved 590 to 628 for step 5 and **628 to 671** for step 6. **What remains is DANN'S WALK OF STEP 6 ON A DEPLOY, and nothing else.** See the section above and the four documents below |
| `[x]` | **N.72** no singer can ever receive a fix | **CLOSED 2026-08-21.** Chrome on iPhone on a stable URL passed: Dann held the branch alias open, ship 4 landed, ONE RELOAD delivered the new build. **Still his to rule, carried over and never asked: a singer on Chrome for iPhone can never install Ilya to the home screen.** |
| | *(2026-08-16 detail, kept)* | **MINIMUM FIX BUILT, awaiting Dann's three-surface walk.** `static/sw.js` carries `__BUILD_VERSION__`, and `apps/web/scripts/stamp-sw.mjs` stamps SvelteKit's per-build version into `build/sw.js` after `vite build`. **The script exits non-zero if it cannot stamp**, because a silent failure would ship the placeholder and reproduce the bug while the build looked healthy. **PROVEN LOCALLY, with a positive control:** a stamped worker makes the browser INSTALL a new one (`registration.waiting` becomes non-null, a second cache appears); the old byte-identical worker NEVER does (`waiting` stays null, one cache). **NOT PROVEN LOCALLY: that the new code is then served.** A static server cannot honestly imitate two Vercel deployments, and three separate harness faults were found trying (a grep matching its own comment text, `cp -R` preserving mtimes so revalidation returned 304, and a build marker that never reached the bundle). **WALKED BY DANN 2026-08-16, Chrome on the desk: the new build arrived after ONE RELOAD**, better than the predicted close-the-tab, and it measured the case that matters, one stamped deploy to the next. **Why it was that quick rather than needing a close is NOT fully accounted for**, and is recorded as observed rather than dressed up as predicted. **NOT WALKED: Chrome on iPhone**, left for another day. **NOT APPLICABLE: the home-screen install.** Chrome on iOS offers no Add to Home Screen, and `InstallPrompt.svelte:48` already excludes `CriOS` and `FxiOS` so Ilya never asks for it. The path exists only in Safari, which Dann does not use. **A singer on Chrome for iPhone can therefore never install Ilya, which is now a known fact rather than a guess, and is Dann's to rule on.** DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED by Dann's ruling: `skipWaiting`, `clients.claim`, the update prompt |
| | | **The finding, as established 2026-08-16:** **ESTABLISHED by reading `static/sw.js`:** `CACHE_VERSION` is the literal `'ilya-v1'` and never changes, so every deploy ships a BYTE-IDENTICAL service worker and the browser never installs a new one; there is no `skipWaiting` and no `clients.claim` (zero occurrences); and the catch-all is `return cached || networkFetch`, so a cached `/` is served STALE and refreshed only for the next load. **Also established:** every deployment is its own frozen origin, so on a sha-pinned URL no reload can ever deliver a newer Ilya. **NOT ESTABLISHED:** the iPhone home-screen case, which cannot be driven from here, and the branch-alias two-reload behaviour, which needs two builds to observe. **Why it matters: Dann does not feel it because he scans sha-pinned URLs. Every singer on a stable URL or a home-screen install would never receive anything shipped tonight.** **The fix, one line:** derive `CACHE_VERSION` from the build so each deploy ships a different worker, add `skipWaiting` and `clients.claim`, and serve navigations network-first rather than stale. **Cost:** roughly fifteen lines in `sw.js` and an hour, of which most is verification, because it can only be proven on a stable URL across two deploys and on a real home-screen install. **Dann to rule where it sits against N.58 and N.59** |
| `[~]` | **N.58** MIDI import | **DEFERRED TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, ruled by Dann 2026-08-21.** Not blocking. Do not write a third scoping brief. |

## OWED, RULED BUT NOT YET DONE

- **`columnAdvance` reserves no room for the turning layer**, and N.106
  widens what a turning unit can occupy on the right. Nothing crowds on
  Without Sun song 1. Closing it means teaching the layout pass an
  analysis-layer measurement; it belongs with N.103's spacing work. Source:
  `docs/sessions/memo-n106-turning-right_r1_2026-09-02.md`, NOT ESTABLISHED.
- **A third was being read as a second by the desk's own predicate**
  (`gap > o.lineGap`), caught by Code in N.106: a stave step is half a
  space, so intervals are counted in steps, never in `lineGap`. The old rule
  had the same flaw. Do not write that predicate again.
- **THREE RESIDUES OF N.104's LOUPE FIX. None is a regression, all three predate
  it, and all three want numbers.** (1) `Loupe.svelte:276-277` still bounds
  `pageMetrics`' head on `[data-hit]`, which is a different question from the
  head's crop: bringing it onto `MUSIC_MARK` makes system 1's tacet measure a
  candidate measure and resizes the loupe's window on every system of the page.
  (2) `Loupe.svelte:218` skips a whole system from the page's ink survey when it
  carries no notes, so a system of nothing but a tacet run draws a numeral the
  survey never sees. **Cannot bite on this document**, where every system with a
  run also carries notes. (3) **`MUSIC_MARK` is pinned by no test.**
  `headBound`'s arithmetic is pinned eight ways; the selector is not, because
  `apps/web`'s vitest has no DOM environment. Source:
  `docs/sessions/memo-n104-loupe-head_r1_2026-08-29.md` §4 and §9.

- **TWO DOCUMENTS FROM 2026-08-17/18 LIVE IN PROJECT KNOWLEDGE, NOT HERE.**
  Nothing else in this folder names them and a session that does not read this
  line will never find them.
  - `claude/gould-beams-delta-pp16-25_2026-08-18.md` — Gould rules 245 to 284,
    Ground Rules pp. 16 to 25, closing v7's gaps item 1 beam pages. **Two
    independent readings, cross-checked.** One flat contradiction on p. 18's
    three-beam rule is recorded UNRESOLVED; do not implement three-beam outer
    placement from it. Four diagram numerals remain unverified.
  - `claude/ruling-semantic-stems-vs-gould-priors_2026-08-18.md` — **Dann's
    ruling: an engraving convention is a PRIOR, not a law.** His Appendices
    assign stem direction a semantic function, stems up for close timbre and
    stems down for open. A Gould prior may bound a DIMENSION; it may not decide
    a MEANING; where a score carries a legend, the legend outranks Gould.
    **This is a constraint on N.59 tier 3, not on tier 2.**
- **Trace `stem_dir`'s consumers in the reader.** `beams.py:264-265` computes
  it and `:310` carries it into the note record. **Whether any stage treats it
  as evidence is NOT ESTABLISHED.** If one does, it is a defect against Dann's
  own scores, which a photograph of Ilya's own output would expose.
  `beams.py:133` reads "S5: one rule, both directions, no directional term",
  read out of a grep and not in context; confirm it.
- **`staff-renderer.ts`'s `positionalUp` now has its citation.** v7 records that
  the helper's beamed-group stem direction is an inference derived from a chord
  rule. Gould p. 24 states it for beams directly, confirmed by both readers:
  the note furthest from the centre of the stave dictates the group's stem
  direction. **Apply the citation the next time that file is touched.**
- **The Gould re-shoot, four spots, would settle every open number.** p. 18's
  three-beam paragraph, and the small diagram numerals on pp. 16, 19, and 21.
- **Step 5's export, single-song half.** Established 2026-08-16: exporting one
  song and restoring a one-song binder into an emptied library both work without
  the list. It is the only thing that would give the chimera warning a detour
  instead of a stop sign. **Dann's ruling: deferred, recorded as owed against
  step 5, NOT folded into 4a.**
- **Remove `bits-ui` from `apps/web/package.json`.** Ruled 2026-08-16: native
  `<dialog>` + `showModal()` is the answer for the delete confirmation AND the
  fingerprint prompt, not bits-ui. **Dann's ruling on timing: not in step 4's
  commit.** It costs zero bytes while nothing imports it, so removing it is
  hygiene, not weight, and it is a lockfile operation. **Do it clean, on its own.**
  Measured before the ruling: one `AlertDialog` cost **+18.7 KB gzipped**
  (392,547 to 411,292), against Fable's ~8 KB budget for all of N.67.
- ~~`InstallPrompt.svelte:83`'s false `role="dialog"`~~ **DONE 2026-08-16**,
  Dann's ruling. It is a bottom banner, not a modal, and `showModal()` would
  have trapped a singer inside an install suggestion. Now `role="region"`, which
  keeps the `aria-label` exposed where a bare div would have dropped it.

## RULINGS DANN OWES. Ask one at a time, at the right moment

### New from N.104, 2026-08-29. Three, none blocking the walk

- **THE BAR-NUMBERS DRAWING IS WAITING ON HIM.** Thirty-two plates in
  `docs/sessions/drawing-bar-numbers_r1_2026-08-29.html`, built on
  `docs/sessions/gould-bar-numbers-p484_2026-08-29.md`. **Gould gives which bars
  are numbered, where, what slope and what framing, and gives no size, no
  weight, no clearance and no horizontal offset**, so five things are his and
  are all convention: size, weight, clearance, the post-rest anchor, and bare
  against parenthesized. **Sections B and C are not independent**: the
  parenthesis crosses back over the barline at two of the three anchors and is
  clear at the third, so width and placement have to be ruled together. Ilya
  draws no bar number today; nothing here is built or proposed.
- **The loupe draws the singer's words in a different typeface than the page
  does**, and has since before N.104. The loupe declares Source Serif 4, which
  is the renderer's own intent; the page's container overrides it to Source
  Sans 3. Measured on «тень»: the clone lays that text out 1.99 units further
  left than the head bound allows, on systems 2, 5, 6 and 7. **Looked at at 9×
  on all four: no ink enters the head**, the overlap falling inside the first
  letter's side bearing. A measured near-miss, not a guarantee. **The fix is
  either which face the loupe draws words in, which is his eye, or measuring
  the bound on the clone, which needs two passes.** Not built.
- **What the correction surface does over a tacet run.** Three proposals in
  `docs/sessions/memo-n104-tacet_r1_2026-08-27.md` §7, unruled since
  2026-08-27. The ship changed nothing there **on desk inference rather than on
  his word**, which is stated so he can wave it off.

### New from N.67 step 5, 2026-08-18. Three copy gaps, all named by Code, none invented

**Code refused to coin a string in all three, which was correct.** The approved
table has no word for these cases, and inventing one would have been writing
French Dann has not seen.

- **A run that only replaced or only skipped says NOTHING.** `importNoticeKey`
  returns null, so answering *Take* on a song you are not in produces no
  sentence. Code's reasoning: the song rises to the top of the list, which is
  visible. **If that reads as silence, it needs a "replaced" string in both
  languages.**
- **A PARTIAL WRITE FAILURE SAYS THE WRONG THING.** Two songs land, one refuses,
  and `binderError` shows `songs.err.write`, which ends "Nothing has changed."
  **Something did change.** The old code was worse, so this is an improvement on
  a defect rather than a new one, but it is not right and no approved string
  fits.
- **`(2) (2)`.** Re-importing a binder of a copy named `… (2)` produces
  `… (2) (2)`, because `uniqueName` numbers the base it is given and the base
  genuinely was `… (2)`. Correct per design §2.3, and it looks odd. Cosmetic.

### New from N.67 step 4b, 2026-08-18. Four, all small, none blocking

- **Boot does not transcribe; a switch does.** Switching songs runs the pipeline
  and draws the transcription; a reload leaves the poem sitting there until the
  singer presses Transcribe. Code named the asymmetry in its memo §6.4 and asked
  which way to close it. **Observed on the deploy 2026-08-18 and confirmed:** the
  reload after the delete showed the poem present, the dictionary loaded, and
  nothing drawn. **Recorded honestly: the coordinator claimed the opposite from a
  pair of screenshots twenty seconds apart, which could not distinguish Ilya
  transcribing from Dann pressing the button, and had to withdraw it.**
- **A song named from its poem never picks up a better name from the score.**
  Memo decision 6.1: the name is written the first time there is material to
  build one from, and is the singer's from then on. Observed: a song auto-named
  `Я тебя любил` from the poem kept that name after a score arrived carrying
  `Я вас любил` and a composer. The rule cannot tell "Ilya guessed" from "Dann
  chose." Rename fixes it in one gesture, so this is a preference, not a defect.
- **The door is on the Transcription tab only.** The Fit tab has the twinned
  binder row by Dann's ruling of 2026-08-16 but no song list, so switching songs
  while working on a score means changing tabs. Code says twinning it is six
  lines and did not do it because the brief named one place.
- **Pressing Delete on a song you are not in appears to switch you into it before
  it asks.** Observed on the deploy: the open song was `Pushkin, control fixture`
  and the dialog opened over an emptied drawer with `Untitled` marked open.
  **NOT ESTABLISHED whether the Delete press caused it or Dann clicked the row
  first; he was asked and the walk moved on.** If Delete does move the singer,
  choosing Keep leaves them somewhere they did not ask to be. Nothing is lost,
  because saving is continuous.

- ~~RULED 2026-08-21: **LEAVE IT**, on Dann's printed sheet rather than on
  arithmetic. Original text kept:~~ **The sage rules print faint in greyscale.** `--sage` is `#8B9A7D`
  (`app.css:33`), about 58% relative luminance, and print swaps `--paper-cream`
  for pure white. Three levers: leave it; darken `--sage` globally, which keeps
  print identical to screen; or darken at print only, which breaks the WYSIWYG
  principle he set in E.51. **Nothing depends on it.**
- ~~`pdfjs-dist`, for N.59 step 8~~ **RULED IN 2026-08-16, Dann: an enthusiastic
  yes.** Registry facts checked first, as he required for `fake-indexeddb`:
  6.2.108, Apache-2.0, zero runtime dependencies, 20.4 million weekly downloads,
  last published 2026-07-28. Built, walked by me, not yet by him.
- ~~THE PHOTOGRAPH COPY, and whether photographs belong in the beta~~ **RULED
  2026-08-17, Dann: photographs stay in the beta, and the copy was corrected in
  the same session. Both languages approved before either was written.**
- ~~Fable's six ratification items of 2026-07-24~~ **RULED 2026-08-17, Dann:
  items 1 and 2 ratified (T3 fence, T4 third precedent class). Items 3 to 6
  concern that session's build balance and wording; whether they were
  satisfied is NOT ESTABLISHED and none blocks anything.**
- ~~Which of N.58 and N.59 is next~~ **RULED 2026-08-16: N.59.** Increment 1
  shipped and was walked.
- **A singer on Chrome for iPhone can never install Ilya to the home screen.**
  Chrome on iOS offers no Add to Home Screen and `InstallPrompt.svelte:48`
  already excludes `CriOS` and `FxiOS`. Established by reading, carried over
  from N.72 where it was named and never ruled.
- ~~**N.63.** Where the honest residue goes~~ **RULED 2026-08-21: SAY NOTHING.**
  Still owed: deleting the gate itself, if it still ships. NOT ESTABLISHED
  whether it does; the last evidence is Fable's finding F5 of 2026-08-18.
- **N.45's remainder.**
- ~~**The French question mark.**~~ **RULED 2026-08-21: no space before `?` in
  Canadian French, a hard space before `:`.** It was 47 sites, not eleven. Shipped
  in `9f11490`. **The 63 `!` and `;` sites are NOT done.**
- *(Not yet: what a deliberately empty note draws.)*

---

## THE SCHEMA. It has survived ten sessions

1. Only blocking work gets built.
2. **A new cardinal displaces a named one or waits. Say which.**
3. Half of every build day is reserved for what the previous day's walk found.
4. Every build day ends in a deploy and a walk.
5. N.48 may be unclosable; it needs a `[u]` that fails.

---

## THE FIXTURE. Read out of the file, do not re-derive it

`~/Downloads/no-lyrics-control.musicxml` is the only instrument that exercises
the no-underlay path; all three of Dann's own scores carry lyrics.

**It holds five pitched notes and one half rest:** C4 D4 E4 F4 quarters, G4 half,
then a half rest. **It is NOT six notes.** Its stripped lyric line was five
syllables, «Я тебя любил». **Its header title is a different text from its lyric
line.**

**The walk, four steps.** Transcribe some Russian, or the queue is empty and
nothing draws. Switch to Fit **before touching any file input.** Upload the
control, press *Continue to analysis*. **Expect `5 / 5`, syllables under the
notes, the rest bare, no dashed boxes.** Walked and confirmed 2026-08-13.

**This same walk is N.67 step 3's observation**, with the expectation stated
before the walk: re-uploading the control over placed syllables no longer erases
them.

**The print fixture, E.51.** Marshak's Russian of Shakespeare's Sonnet 90, under
Kabalevsky op. 52 no. 9, fourteen lines. **It fills exactly two letter sheets.**

---

## RULED 2026-08-16, ON E.55'S WALK FINDINGS

- **The walk's findings come before N.67 step 4**, per the schema's own rule
  that half of every build day is reserved for what the previous walk found.
- **N.70 and N.71 are numbered. The third finding, no cursor on a note, is
  FOLDED INTO N.71** rather than tracked: one CSS declaration on the same
  element as N.71's fix.
- **N.55b's row is corrected rather than left tidy**, Dann's words.
- **The N.70 fix is Dann's own third option**, better than either I posed:
  filtered on desktop, no `accept` at all on iOS. Named consequence, accepted:
  the tree's `isMobile` is a WIDTH test, so a narrow desktop window also gets
  the unfiltered picker.

## STILL UNSETTLED. Not yours to settle alone

- **Where the storage notices belong.** They render in the FIT drawer only, so a
  singer working in Transcription never sees a save failure or the two-tab
  notice. Inherited from when they were pairing notices; not moved in E.54
  because moving them is a placement decision, not a build step.
- **The three storage strings still say "syllable placements"** and the save is
  now the whole song. Design §7 puts that copy in step 6, with the French shown
  to Dann first, so it was left alone rather than rewritten twice.

- "The page carries no chrome." · "Do not introduce a slider."
- **N.51:** whether per-tab colour may propagate past the tab bar.
- Whether `claude/shane-project-map_2026-07-25.md` is stale. **Unopened for
  twelve sessions.**
- **D3's Job A**, per-verse reprints, ruled in E.36 and still unnumbered.
- **The per-format score arrival audit**, asked for in E.45 and never written.
- ~~`stripBackingRect` matches `fill="#FFFFFF"` while `staff-renderer.ts` paints
  `#F0EBE0`.~~ **SETTLED 2026-09-07 by Dann's print preview: the cream prints. Ruled: the page prints white. Paste written (INBOX), not yet run.**
- **The marks on the printed page.** E.51's prints carry a dashed `VERIFY` box
  and a `USER OVERRIDE` badge on paper. CONTRACT §6 forbids a mark that says Ilya
  is unsure. **Whether these are the ruled exception was not checked.**
- **`VoiceProfilePane.svelte:295-313` duplicates the old header arithmetic.**
  Fit's paper does not yet share the Transcribe paper's single `HEADER_GAP`.
- **Whether `.mscz` ingest actually succeeds in a browser.** The path is live in
  code (`ScoreUploader.svelte:106-137`) but `i18n.ts:272` still carries a
  "coming soon" string for it. Nobody has run it.

---

## Register corrections owed

`claude/ILYA-REGISTER_2026-08-11.md` is at revision 10 and needs revision 11.
Its N.55a row is FALSE (N.55a is CLOSED). It says "ten cardinals" over a list of
twelve; **five actually remain and none is in the tree: N.1, N.2, N.3, N.18,
N.21.** Its N.55b row is stale. **The blocking number is now THREE.**

**Or fold the register into this file and retire it.** It is the last piece of
canon still living in project knowledge.

---

*Split 2026-09-01. `STATE.md` was 3,089 lines and 207 KB. The session history,
the `## Log` table, and three stale colophons moved to `../sessions/LOG.md`.
What stays is what `README.md` asks a new session to read: the one thing, the
tracker, and the rulings Dann owes. Backup of the pre-split file:
`STATE.md.bak-2026-09-01`.*
