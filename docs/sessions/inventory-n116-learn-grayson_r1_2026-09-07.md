| About This Module | learn-about | 2077 | Frames Learn as a pedagogical resequencing of Grayson's 2012 dissertation for singers, situates Grayson among earlier Russian diction resources (Challis, Piatak and Avrashov, Richter, Belov, Olin, McMaster, Thomas), and states three boundaries: not a Russian course, not a substitute for Grayson, not a guide to using Ilya. |
| The Learning Arc | learn-arc | 2085 | States the module's seven-unit structure and its single governing principle, quoted below. |
| The Letters (Section 1) | learn-unit-1 | 2092 | Introduces all 33 modern Cyrillic letters plus 4 obsolete pre-1918 letters, their names, categories, and default IPA anchors. |
| The Russian Alphabet Song | learn-u1-song | 2100 | Presents a mnemonic song (arr. Dann Mitton 2017, after Ken Griffiths) that sets all 33 letters in dictionary order to a folk melody. |
| The Alphabet | learn-u1-alphabet | 2109 | Gives the full letter-by-letter table (name, category, IPA anchor, notes) referenced above. |
| What You Already Know | learn-u1-familiar | 2160 | Sorts the alphabet by visual familiarity to Latin-script readers into "Familiar Shapes," "False Friends," and "New Shapes," each with its own table. |
| The Two Signs | learn-u1-signs | 2230 | Explains that ⟨ь⟩ (soft sign) palatalises the preceding consonant and ⟨ъ⟩ (hard sign) blocks that palatalisation, with neither carrying a sound of its own. |
| A Note on ⟨Ё⟩ | learn-u1-yo | 2240 | Warns that Russian print often omits the diaeresis on ⟨ё⟩, printing it as ⟨е⟩, changing both stress and vowel quality, and describes how Ilya restores it. |
| The Glyph Table | learn-u1-glyphs | 2244 | Presents a scrollable table of letterforms across serif, serif italic, and sans typefaces, flagging shapes that depart radically from Latin forms. |
| Try This | learn-u1-try | 2719 | Directs the reader to paste Russian text into Ilya's Transcription tab and notice how letters transform under stress and palatalisation, previewing Sections 2 to 7. |
| Stress (Section 2) | learn-unit-2 | 2731 | Establishes that Russian stress is lexical (word-by-word, not rule-governed) and classifies vowels into three stress-behaviour categories that govern Sections 3 and 4. |
| Stress changes meaning. | learn-u2-meaning | 2750 | Gives homograph pairs (мука/мука, стоит/стоит, уже/уже) where stress position alone changes meaning. |
| Stress moves. | learn-u2-moves | 2768 | Shows that stress shifts across grammatical forms of the same word, using вода's declension as the example. |
| Stress is a dictionary problem. | learn-u2-dictionary | 2783 | Argues that stress exceptions are too numerous for rules, so Ilya resolves stress via a dictionary of 943,096 entries rather than derivation, and describes how Ilya flags unresolved or ambiguous cases. |
| How stress sounds. | learn-u2-sounds | 2789 | Explains that sung Russian communicates stress through intensity and articulatory commitment rather than duration, since the composer fixes rhythm. |
| Try this in Ilya. | learn-u2-try | 2793 | Exercise: transcribe стоит under each stress placement and observe the vowel changes. |
| Spotting the missing ⟨ё⟩. | learn-u2-yo | 2797 | Lists suffix patterns (-ёнок, -ёр, -ённ-) where a missing diaeresis commonly hides ⟨ё⟩, and flags все/всё as the highest-frequency homograph pair in art song. |
| Stressed Vowels (Section 3) | learn-unit-3 | 2817 | Introduces the six stable, stressed cardinal vowel sounds of sung Russian as the targets that all later transformations depart from. |
| A note on /o/ | learn-u3-note-o | 2851 | Extended discussion of Russian /o/ as a fusion vowel (closed lips over an open tongue position), the disagreement among sources on /o/ versus /ɔ/, and why Grayson transcribes it simply as /o/. |
| Two vowels change colour near soft consonants. | learn-u3-interpalatal | 2858 | Details the "three roads to [e]" (interpalatal, always-hard-preceding, word-initial ⟨э⟩) and the "one road to [a]" (truly interpalatal ⟨а⟩/⟨я⟩), each with counter-examples. |
| Four vowel letters carry a hidden consonant. | learn-u3-iotated | 2906 | Explains iotated vowels (⟨я⟩, ⟨е⟩, ⟨ё⟩, ⟨ю⟩): a j-glide in certain positions, or a palatalisation signal with no glide after a consonant. |
| ⟨ё⟩ is always stressed. | learn-u3-yo | 2932 | States that ⟨ё⟩'s stress is the one fully predictable stress in Russian, and that Ilya restores the letter from its dictionary when print omits the diaeresis. |
| Try this in Ilya. | learn-u3-try | 2938 | Exercise: transcribe шесть versus шест to hear the always-hard road to [e] triggered by cluster softness. |
| Vowel Reduction (Section 4) | learn-unit-4 | 2944 | Introduces vowel reduction as the loss of vowel distinctiveness under lack of stress, distinguishes the three unaffected vowels from the three that transform, and catalogues five unstressed vowel sounds. |
| ⟨о⟩ and ⟨а⟩ follow different paths when unstressed. | learn-u4-akanye | 2967 | Describes akanye: a full position-by-position table showing where ⟨о⟩ and ⟨а⟩ converge and where (immediately post-stress) they diverge, with хорошо as the worked example. |
| ⟨е⟩ and ⟨я⟩ reduce toward [ɪ]. | learn-u4-ikanye | 2989 | Describes ikanye and its two refinements: reduction to [ɨ] after always-hard consonants, and fronting to /i/ in interpalatal position. |
| Reconstitution is an informed choice, not an obligation. | learn-u4-reconstitution | 3005 | Explains reconstitution (partially undoing reduction on sustained notes), the "one-way door" from [ʌ] back to /ɑ/ but never to /o/, and includes a signed editorial note from Dann Mitton disputing one of Grayson's reconstitution claims (citing Dr. Alexei Kochetov) and describing where Ilya departs from Grayson's rule. |
| Try this in Ilya. | learn-u4-try | 3036 | Exercise: transcribe хорошо and жена with reconstitution toggled on and off. |
| The Consonants (Section 5) | learn-unit-5 | 3046 | Introduces the 21 consonant letters, notes that Russian consonants are dental rather than alveolar, and previews the five that need focused attention. |
| How familiar is the Russian consonant system? | learn-u5-familiar | 3054 | Full consonant-by-consonant table giving IPA, closest equivalent in another lyric diction language, and articulatory notes. |
| Which consonants form voiced-voiceless pairs? | learn-u5-pairs | 3085 | Tables the six voiced-voiceless obstruent pairs, names the four sonorants and the glide /j/ as exempt from voicing assimilation, and flags ⟨ц⟩ and ⟨ч⟩ as having no dedicated voiced counterpart letter. |
| Which sounds require the singer's focused attention? | learn-u5-attention | 3107 | Umbrella heading (h4) over five h5 subsections on ⟨л⟩, ⟨х⟩, ⟨р⟩, the hushers, and the affricates. |
| The two sounds of Russian ⟨л⟩ | learn-u5-l | 3109 | Distinguishes velarised hard-l [ɫ] from palatalised soft-l [lʲ], gives the conditioning environments for each, and quotes Grayson (p. 184) on how Russian /lʲ/ differs from Italian [ʎ]. |
| ⟨х⟩: the velar fricative | learn-u5-x | 3126 | Distinguishes Russian /x/, articulated at the front of the velum, from the German uvular achlaut. |
| ⟨р⟩: the trill | learn-u5-r | 3130 | States that sung Russian /r/ is always lightly trilled, with length varying by position, and warns against an Italian-caricature trill. |
| The hushers: ⟨ж⟩, ⟨ш⟩, and ⟨щ⟩ | learn-u5-hushers | 3134 | Describes the ladle-shaped tongue posture for ⟨ж⟩/⟨ш⟩ and distinguishes single-length ⟨ш⟩ from double-length palatalised ⟨щ⟩, noting the Moscow versus older St. Petersburg pronunciation of ⟨щ⟩. |
| The affricates: ⟨ц⟩ and ⟨ч⟩ | learn-u5-affricates | 3140 | Explains ⟨ц⟩ /ts/ and ⟨ч⟩ /tʃʲ/ as single phonemes despite multi-symbol IPA spelling. |
| Which consonants never change hardness or softness? | learn-u5-fixed | 3146 | Names the three always-hard (⟨ж⟩, ⟨ш⟩, ⟨ц⟩) and two always-soft (⟨ч⟩, ⟨щ⟩) consonants, notes that a following soft sign is ignored after the always-hard three, and states their role as palatalisation boundaries. |
| What do the two signs do? | learn-u5-signs | 3177 | Umbrella heading over two h5 subsections detailing the functional roles of ⟨ь⟩ and ⟨ъ⟩, each with minimal-pair tables. |
| ⟨ь⟩ (мягкий знак): the soft sign | learn-u5-soft | 3181 | Describes the soft sign's primary palatalising function and its secondary function of inserting a /j/ glide before a following iotated vowel. |
| ⟨ъ⟩ (твёрдый знак): the hard sign | learn-u5-hard | 3198 | Describes the hard sign's post-1918 role between a prefix and an iotated-vowel root, blocking palatalisation and forcing a glide. |
| What happens to voiced consonants at the end of a word? | learn-u5-devoicing | 3212 | States the final-devoicing rule (voiced obstruents devoice word-finally, as in German), gives worked examples, and notes the sonorants' exemption. |
| Try this in Ilya | learn-u5-try | 3235 | Exercise: transcribe мал versus мальчик to hear velarised versus palatalised ⟨л⟩, and друг to hear final devoicing. |
| Palatalization (Section 6) | learn-unit-6 | 3245 | Section banner; the section is organised as one umbrella h4 with the mechanism, followed by six further h4 subsections (6.2 through 6.7 in the prose's own numbering, referenced in-text as 6.1 to 6.7). |
| What Palatalization Is | learn-u6-what | 3249 | Defines palatalization as a simultaneous secondary articulation (tongue toward the hard palate) rather than a sequential consonant+glide, cites Grayson's "arch, pronounce, peel" model (Grayson 2012, 205) and his use of [ɲ] over [nʲ], and gives everyday English analogues ("key" vs "car"). |
| What Signals Palatalization on the Page? What Do I Look for? | learn-u6-signals | 3389 | Lists the "palatalizing agents" (soft sign, soft-series vowels, ⟨ч⟩/⟨щ⟩, another palatalized consonant), introduces regressive assimilation of palatalization, covers the 1989 Kiel Convention's modern IPA superscript notation versus deprecated palatal-hook symbols, and notes Cheri Montgomery's workbook as the only other print resource using the modern notation consistently. |
| What Stops the Spread? | learn-u6-stops | 3486 | Tables six boundaries that halt regressive palatalization: always-hard consonants, a vowel, the hard sign (with a ⟨в⟩/⟨с⟩/⟨з⟩ exception), a new palatalizing agent, the word boundary, and punctuation (citing Grayson 2012, 206 and 208). |
| Paired versus Unpaired | learn-u6-paired | 3581 | Tables the fifteen paired (hard/soft) consonants against the five unpaired (three always-hard, two always-soft). |
| Regressive Palatalization in Clusters | learn-u6-clusters | 3634 | Gives five rules (from Derwing and Priestly 1980) governing which consonants palatalize regressively within a cluster by place of articulation, plus a described "progressive exception" for /r/ after a stressed front vowel (citing Grayson 2012, 209). |
| Putting It Together | learn-u6-practice | 3712 | Seven worked examples of increasing complexity (стол through симметрический), adapted from Grayson (2012, 210 to 211), applying the rules from the preceding subsections. |
| Velar-i [ɨ] | learn-u6-velari | 3748 | Explains [ɨ] as the vowel Russian produces where palatalization cannot reach, gives its articulatory description, worked examples (жить, цирк), and extends the principle across word boundaries (к Игорю). |
| Assimilation and Boundaries (Section 7) | learn-unit-7 | 3799 | Section banner distinguishing palatalization (a tongue-arch question) from voicing assimilation (a larynx-vibration question), both regressive. |
| Two Kinds of Regressive Assimilation | learn-u7-two | 3803 | Direct comparison table of voicing assimilation versus palatalization (physical locus, binary, direction, trigger), establishing that a single consonant can undergo both independently. |
| What Happens When Voiced Meets Voiceless? | learn-u7-voiced | 3829 | States the core rule (the rightmost obstruent in a cluster sets the voicing of the whole cluster), gives worked multi-consonant examples, tables the six paired plus three allophonic-only voiced/voiceless pairs, and introduces the ⟨в⟩ exception (it undergoes but does not trigger assimilation) and the мягко/легче exception routing ⟨г⟩ through /x/. |
| What Stops the Spread of Voicing? | learn-u7-stops | 3874 | Names four constraints: only obstruents trigger it, sonorants block transmission, the ⟨в⟩ exception, and punctuation as an absolute boundary. |
| Do the Same Voicing Rules Apply between Words? | learn-u7-boundary | 3898 | States that voicing assimilation crosses the word boundary under the same rules, citing Grayson's four cross-boundary rules (pp. 250 to 251), introduces proclitics and enclitics, and covers the three allophones ([dz], [dʒʲ], [ɣ]) that arise only through cross-boundary assimilation. |
| Where Did the L Go? Consonant Deletion | learn-u7-deletion | 3932 | Tables ten consonant clusters where a letter is silently deleted (стн, здн, стл, etc.), with сердце, поздно, солнце, and здравствуйте as worked examples. |
| Mergers and Acquisitions | learn-u7-mergers | 3957 | Tables consonant-cluster mergers into a single lengthened sound (сж → /ʒː/, сч → /ʃʲʃʲ/, etc.), and separately treats the context-dependent -тс-/-дс-/-тьс- clusters and the цвет exception. |
| Two Rules-of-One: скучно and что | learn-u7-unusual | 3981 | Names the "скучно rule" and "что rule," where ⟨ч⟩ loses its stop component and reduces to /ʃ/ in specific words but not their near-relatives (конечный, нечто). |
| Twice the Fun: Geminates | learn-u7-geminates | 3997 | Explains that Russian geminates are understated (quoting Grayson p. 226), tables which doubled-letter clusters double in pronunciation and which do not, and describes Ilya's geminate notation toggles. |
| Try This in Ilya | learn-u7-tryit | 4017 | Consolidated exercise set covering voicing assimilation, cross-boundary assimilation, deletion, merger, rules-of-one, and geminates, closing the "Teaching Layer" of Learn. |
| What These Rules Do Not Teach (Section 8) | learn-coda | 4039 | Argues that some correct pronunciations (смерть's palatalized /sʲ/, скучно's elision, сейчас's full lyric form) are lexically or traditionally governed rather than rule-derivable, and states that Ilya handles these through cited, non-generalising word-specific annotations rather than rules. |
| Try This | learn-try | 4057 | Closing summary of the "paste into Transcription tab" pedagogical device used throughout the module. |
| A Note on Notation | learn-notation | 4061 | States that IPA notation choices are paradigmatic rather than absolute, that ten print resources show ten different approaches, and that Ilya's notation toggles make these choices visible and reversible. |

Note on ids: `learn-coda`, `learn-try`, and `learn-notation` are each used twice in this file, once in the French half (lines 2034, 2052, 2056) and again in the English half (lines 4039, 4057, 4061). This is a duplicate-id situation across the two language halves of the same document; see Section 4.

The module's own stated structure, from "The Learning Arc" (line 2085 to 2087):

> "The module is organised into seven units that follow a single governing principle: meet the sounds first, then learn what happens to them."

The seven units are then presented as a `chapter-band` banner immediately before each h3: The Letters, Stress, Stressed Vowels, Vowel Reduction, The Consonants, Palatalization, and Assimilation and Boundaries. An eighth section, "What These Rules Do Not Teach," follows as a coda outside the seven-unit arc, explicitly marking material that resists the rule-based system taught in Sections 1 to 7.

## 2. Grayson's dissertation

Page numbers are given as "physical N (printed M)" where physical N is the pdftotext page count from the start of the PDF file and printed M is the dissertation's own printed page number at that location (front matter uses roman numerals i to x; I give the arabic equivalent as "printed 1" is the first page of the Introduction). The offset between physical and printed page in the body and appendices is a constant +16, confirmed by cross-checking a dozen headings against the running page-number line pdftotext extracts.

| Chapter / section | Physical (printed) page | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 3 to 4 | Summarises the dissertation's two purposes: a survey of four existing Russian lyric diction guides plus three dissertations, and Grayson's own annotated guide; states that the guide "advances in difficulty" as it proceeds (quoted below). |

Grayson's own words on the guide's order of difficulty. The clearest statement is in the Abstract (physical page 4):

> "The annotated guide introduces the sung sounds of Russian and the corresponding Cyrillic letters, advancing in difficulty and covering elements of articulation, phonological rules, and Cyrillic orthography. As the chapters advance, the most important elements of Russian phonological theory are explored in greater depth."

A second, more specific statement of the same claim appears in the Preface (physical page 75, printed page 59), describing the guide's chapter-by-chapter progression:

> "This text gradually introduces the sounds of Russian and the Cyrillic alphabet. The Russian speech sounds are organized into two chapters, the Vowels and the Consonants. Each chapter leads from the most familiar phonemes and intuitive Cyrillic letters to the most difficult and unusual... As the next chapters advance in number, so do their topics advance in complexity. The topics trend from palatalization to assimilation as applied to final consonants, consonant clusters, and vowels to syllabic stress, patterns of shifting stress, vowel reduction and reconstitution to unusual grammatical forms and common pronunciation exceptions. The concluding chapter covers historical, political and social issues that have affected Russian spelling and pronunciation, and what those sounds and/or spellings are today."

Note that the task brief describes this passage as appearing "in the introduction"; in the PDF as extracted, the "advances in difficulty" wording is in the Abstract (physical page 4) and the fuller "advance in complexity" restatement is in the Preface to Chapter 2 (physical page 75), not in the unnumbered "Introduction" section (physical pages 17 to 18), which I read in full and which does not contain this claim in these words.

## 3. Side by side

Judgments here are limited to matching subject matter; no claim is made about which treatment is better.

| Learn section | Corresponding Grayson section(s) | In both / Grayson only / Learn only | Learn's citation of Grayson |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Letters (Section 1) | Ch. 2 (guide layout), Appendices B and D | In both | Cited explicitly: "Ch. 2, Appendices B and D" (line 2727). |
| Stress (Section 2) | Ch. 7 (Syllabic Stress, pp. 263 to 273), Ch. 2 (pp. 65 to 66), Ch. 8 §1 (pp. 274 to 278) | In both | Cited explicitly, with page ranges (line 2812). Also cites Baytukalov "cited in Grayson p. 273," a source reached through Grayson rather than Grayson's own words. |
| Stressed Vowels (Section 3), incl. the /o/ note | Ch. 3 §1, §3 (cardinal and unstressed vowels), Appendix K "The Story of /o/" (pp. 359 to 397) | In both | Cited by name for the /o/ material: "Grounded in Grayson (2012), Appendix K, 'The Story of /o/', pp. 359 to 397" (svelte comment, line 2849 to 2850, not visible to the reader but present in source). The rendered prose also names "Grayson's spectral analysis (Appendix K...)" directly (line 2854). |
| Vowel Reduction (Section 4), incl. reconstitution | Ch. 3 §§3, 5, 7 to 8 (pp. 97 to 129), Ch. 7 §1 (pp. 263 to 267); reconstitution chart p. 128, note p. 129; fn. 306 on p. 266 | In both, with one explicit, signed departure | Cited explicitly with page numbers (line 3042). The reconstitution callout (lines 3025 to 3032) quotes Grayson directly ("remain sung as [ɨ]," p. 129) and then argues against part of his rule, making this the one place Learn is knowingly Learn-only in its conclusion while remaining Grayson-sourced in its premises. |
| The Consonants (Section 5) | Ch. 4 (all sections), Ch. 5 §1 | In both | Cited explicitly: "Ch. 4 (all sections), Ch. 5 §1" (line 3241). Also quotes Grayson directly on Russian /lʲ/ versus Italian [ʎ] (p. 184, line 3124) and on Russian /x/ ("articulated on the front of the velum," line 3128, page not given in that sentence). |
| Palatalization (Section 6) | Ch. 4 §2 (p. 169 quoted), Ch. 5 §§1 to 2 (pp. 204 to 211), Ch. 6 §1 (Old Muscovite clusters, p. 209) | In both | Cited with in-line page numbers throughout the section (2012, 169; 205; 206; 208; 209; 210 to 211) rather than in a single trailing source line, unlike other sections. This is the most densely page-cited section of Learn. |
| Assimilation and Boundaries (Section 7) | Ch. 5 §§2 to 5 (pp. 150 to 262), Ch. 7 §2 (pp. 247 to 258), Appendix F (pp. 312 to 313) | In both | Cited explicitly with page ranges (line 4035). Note this citation's chapter numbering for "voicing across word boundaries" material (attributed here to "Ch. 7 §2") differs from the earlier, in-line citation two paragraphs above it in the same section, which places the "four rules for assimilation of voicing across word boundaries" at "pp. 250 to 251" (line 3902), a page range that falls within Chapter 6 §3 in Grayson's own table of contents, not Chapter 7. This is flagged, not resolved, in Section 4 below. |
| What These Rules Do Not Teach (Section 8) | Not tied to a specific Grayson chapter; references Stage pronunciation scholarship "attested by Avanesov, Derwing and Priestly, and Grayson" | Learn only (as a section) | No page-numbered Grayson citation; this section is explicitly framed as being about the limits of any rule-based system, including Grayson's. |
| A Note on Notation | References the 1989 Kiel Convention (covered inside Grayson's Preliminaries, physical page 77/printed 61) and surveys "ten Russian lyric diction print resources" | Learn only, drawing on background covered in Grayson's Preliminaries | No direct Grayson citation in this closing section. |
| Grayson Ch. 1 (Survey of Relevant Texts) | — | Grayson only | Not mirrored in Learn as a section, though Learn's opening "About This Module" (Section 1 above) references several of the same authors (Challis, Piatak and Avrashov, Richter, Belov, Weiler, Mills-Bello under a different spelling "Mills-Bell") that Grayson surveys in Chapter 1, without citing Chapter 1 by name or page. |
| Grayson Ch. 8 (Unusual Spelling and Grammatical Forms) | — | Grayson only | Not mirrored by any Learn section; Learn's Section 2 on stress cites only Ch. 8 §1 narrowly (the missing-ё material), not the chapter's other four sections on suffixes, reflexive endings, and pronunciation exceptions. |
| Grayson Ch. 9 (History, Politics and the Russian Language) | — | Grayson only | Not mirrored by any Learn section or citation found. |
| Grayson's "A Note on Style, Vocal Technique" and "A Note for the Chorus Master" essays | — | Grayson only | Not mirrored or cited in Learn. |
| Grayson Appendices A, C, E, G, H, I, J, L, M | — | Grayson only | Not cited by Learn, except that Appendix M (suggested listening) is referenced in spirit, uncited, when Learn's "About This Module" discusses listening to native singers; and Appendix B and D are cited (see Section 1 row above). |
| Grayson Appendix K essays other than "The Story of /o/" (Shcha-Cha-Cha, The Problem of Schwa, Cyril and Methodius) | — | Grayson only | Not cited in Learn; only "The Story of /o/" is drawn on. |

## 4. NOT ESTABLISHED

- Appendix G ("Russian Composer Names: Cyrillic, IPA, and Transliterations," TOC page printed 354): `pdftotext -layout` returned no page-number line, no heading, and no text for the physical page where this appendix should fall (physical page 370, between Appendix F's closing content on physical 369 and Appendix H's "APPENDIX H" heading on physical 371). The physical page contains only the printed page-footer number "354." NOT ESTABLISHED: the physical page number of Appendix G's heading, and the content of the appendix itself. This is most likely explained by the appendix being a table (composer names, IPA, and transliterations) rendered as an image or in a way `pdftotext` could not extract, but I did not open the PDF visually to confirm this, per the constraint to use pdftotext only.

- Several TOC-listed subsection headings in Chapters 4, 6, 8, and 9 (marked "(TOC only)" in the Section 2 table above) were not independently located and read in the extracted body text; I confirmed the parent Section heading's physical page in the body but relied on the TOC's stated page number, adjusted by the confirmed +16 offset, for the subsection row itself. These are: the four Chapter 4 §1 subsections (Cognates, Greeks, False Friends, Hushers plus W); most Chapter 4 §2 subsections (Hushers, Special Case, Dentals, Labials, Lateral/Nasals, Velars, /rʲ/); the Chapter 4 §3 subsections (Hard Sign, Soft Sign); the Chapter 6 §1 and §3 sub-items; the Chapter 7 §2 sub-items; most of Chapter 8 §1's sub-items; and most of Chapter 9's sub-items. I did not treat any of these page numbers as guesses: they come from the TOC's own printed statement plus a confirmed constant offset, but I flag them as not independently confirmed against body text, per the task's instruction to distinguish confirmed headings from TOC-derived ones.

- Grayson's TOC contains visible OCR/font-substitution garbling in several rows where the source PDF's dissertation-specific Cyrillic and IPA font did not map to standard Unicode in `pdftotext`'s extraction. Examples: "Pronoun Problems: x/v, xtv, dc/, dct, dc/v, and dctv" (TOC line, physical page 10/line 312), "The Suffixes -wbz and -wbjyysq" (physical page 10 to 11), and "O : /R&R&/ versus /R&sR&/" (physical page 11, almost certainly representing the Cyrillic letter щ and an IPA contrast, matched to the confirmed Appendix K essay title "Shcha-Cha-Cha! The History of the Shifting Pronunciation of О" at physical page 12/line 375, itself also likely a garbled щ). I have rendered these as best-guess modern equivalents in the Section 2 table where the referent was unambiguous (e.g., "Looking up ⟨ё⟩ or not" for the garbled "Looking up -/- or not"), and flagged the garbling in the table's own text where I made that substitution. Where I was not confident of the referent, I left the TOC's literal (garbled) text with a note. This whole class of heading should be treated as NOT ESTABLISHED in exact original wording, only in approximate meaning.

- Similarly, Learn's own IPA table for stressed vowels (Section 1 of this inventory) transcribes some Cyrillic and IPA symbols cleanly (it is a modern web document, not an OCR extraction), so no equivalent garbling applies to the Learn side. No Learn heading's line number is approximate; all were located by exact string search against the file as delivered.

- The apparent citation discrepancy noted in Section 3 (Learn's Section 7 closing source line attributing cross-boundary voicing rules to "Ch. 7 §2," while an in-line citation two paragraphs earlier in the same section places the same rules at "pp. 250 to 251," which falls inside Grayson's own Chapter 6 §3 by the confirmed TOC and body page numbers) is reported as a factual observation about the two citations as written. I did not attempt to determine which citation Learn's author intended as authoritative, or whether this is a typo; that would require asking the author. NOT ESTABLISHED: whether this is an error in Learn or reflects some Grayson cross-reference I have not located.

- I did not verify the accuracy of any phonetic or phonological claim in either source against outside linguistic authority. This inventory is a structural and descriptive mapping only, per the task's instruction not to evaluate quality.

- I did not open the PDF in a PDF viewer or use OCR; all Grayson content in this document comes from `pdftotext -layout` output. Where a table's internal cell alignment may have shifted during extraction (this is common with `pdftotext -layout` on multi-column tables), I have not attempted to reconstruct exact column contents beyond what was needed to confirm a heading's existence and general subject, and no such table content is quoted verbatim in this inventory except where marked as a direct quotation matched against the surrounding prose (not a table cell).

- Learn's French half (lines 1 to approximately 2076, and the shared closing material) was read only enough to locate the boundary with the English half and to identify the duplicate-id issue noted in Section 1; per the task's scope, it was not inventoried.
