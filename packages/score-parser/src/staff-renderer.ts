/**
 * Bespoke SVG staff renderer for the isolated vocal melody plus Shane's
 * Appendix B analytical markup. Chosen over driving an engraver (OSMD /
 * Verovio) by the renderer spike (2026-07-12): the turning-pitch
 * noteheads and red crossing boxes are not notation primitives, so any
 * engraver route needs a fragile coordinate-mapping overlay anyway; the
 * melody-only staff is bounded enough to render ourselves and own every
 * coordinate (and every `data-event-id` for the correction UI).
 *
 * This is the production layout engine (increment 4). It handles:
 *   - proportional rhythmic spacing (x by onset time, with a minimum gap);
 *   - multiple measures with barlines;
 *   - a clef (treble, treble-8vb, or bass; source clef when captured,
 *     else the tessitura heuristic — v37 §A.17) and the key signature
 *     at that clef's standard positions;
 *   - accidentals (sung line and turning layer) with per-measure carry and
 *     the measure-opening barline nudge (Kimi's collision rule);
 *   - ledger lines; rests; flags for unbeamed short notes;
 *   - beaming, derived by beat (Dann's ruling, 2026-07-12): the data model
 *     carries no source beams, and the forced semantic stems would break an
 *     engraver's groups anyway, so groups are computed here — flagged notes
 *     joined within one measure, one beat (compound-metre aware), and one
 *     timbre, with multi-level beams and stubs for mixed values;
 *   - tuplet brackets and numerals in standard black (Dann's ruling,
 *     2026-07-12: the appendix sample's blue is engraving cosmetics);
 *   - the four analytical marks (forced semantic stems, lavender turning-pitch
 *     noteheads, red crossing squircles, dual Cyrillic/IPA underlay) and the
 *     `#` phonation break. The turning layer (Mitton 2020, App. B pref.
 *     p. 206) renders in Calm Authority's lavender (#8E7E9B, the
 *     `--deeper-lavender` app
 *     token; see the TURNING_COLOUR constant below), noteheads and
 *     accidentals in one colour, with
 *     its own per-measure accidental carry state independent of the sung
 *     line (Dann's rulings, 2026-07-12);
 *   - TWO RENDERING MODES: pass `options.font` (a `PreparedSmuflFont`) and
 *     `options.fontFamily` for production SMuFL glyph output (clef, heads,
 *     accidentals, rests, flags as font glyphs; stems from the font's
 *     anchors; thicknesses from its engraving defaults). Omit `font` for
 *     the primitive shapes, which stay byte-stable for sandbox tests.
 *
 * Deliberately deferred to later increments: multi-system pagination onto
 * the letter Paper page; wiring to live overlay data and the correction-UI
 * editable bindings.

 * N.10b: the sigla for a syllable the resolver declined to transcribe.
 *
 * DANN'S RULING, 8 August 2026, and his reasoning is the point: "Human beings
 * will see a question mark sigla and know to seek out a legend. That's what is
 * important here, not the semantics of the sigla itself." A typeset `[?]` was
 * built first and he rejected it, correctly: set in a text face on the IPA
 * line it reads as content, and nothing about it says look this up. A drawn
 * mark in a colour the transcription never uses reads as apparatus.
 *
 * It is the same traced question mark `PageFooter.svelte` already draws for
 * Transcribe's `inferred`, deliberately reused rather than invented. That
 * carries a known ambiguity, put to Dann and accepted by him: on Transcribe
 * the glyph means "the engine had no entry and guessed", here it means
 * "nothing was printed at all". He ruled the recognisability worth more than
 * the distinction.
 *
 * The path lives HERE, in the module that draws it on the page, and
 * `PageFooter` imports it for the legend circle, so the mark and its legend
 * entry cannot drift into being two different glyphs.
 *
 * `--deeper-lavender`, `app.css:69`. Fit's own accent, and a colour the
 * underlay's ink and the acoustic marks both leave alone.

      /* ── THE COURTESY ACCIDENTAL ACROSS A BARLINE (N.102, increment 1) ──
         Gould p.81, extraction v7 rule 121, as distilled by the desk in
         `brief-n102-courtesy-accidentals_r1_2026-09-02.md` §2: a pitch altered
         in one bar and repeated in the next carries either a restated
         accidental or an explicit cancellation, EVEN THOUGH the barline has
         reset it, and even when the key signature already restores the pitch.
         The extraction itself is not on this machine, so the rule's own words
         are the brief's paraphrase and not a quotation. Until now this file
         had no courtesy accidental of any kind, and what a walk once read as
         one was a mandatory cancellation
         (`memo-mobile-slice4_r1_2026-08-27.md` §1).

         THE BRANCH IS AN `else`, so it can only fire where the required
         accidental did not. The three conditions on it are r121's own: the
         pitch was altered in the directly preceding bar (`prevMeasureAcc` has
         the key), it now sounds at a different alter, and no accidental has
         been stated for it yet in THIS bar. A required accidental is never
         parenthesized, and nothing here changes one.

         IT IS DRAWN ONCE. Writing `measureAcc` makes the bar behave as though
         the accidental had been stated, and clearing the key from
         `prevMeasureAcc` makes a second recurrence in this same bar draw
         nothing. Either alone would do it; both are written because the
         invariant is worth stating twice rather than inferring.

         KEYED ON STEP AND OCTAVE (r116), so B flat in bar 1 says nothing at
         all about a B in another octave in bar 2.

         AND IT IS INK, NOT A CONFIDENCE MARK. `#1a1612`, the same colour as
         every required accidental, never the analysis layer's lavender. A
         courtesy accidental is an engraving convention. It does not say Ilya
         is unsure; it says the singer is not misreading.

         SCOPE. Sung line only, this desk's default. The turning layer keeps
         its own per-measure state and draws no courtesy at all. Rule 122, the
         generous cautionaries of chromatic music, is NOT built here. */

             bare accidental's right edge would, so the accidental keeps the
             position the required one would have taken and the brackets grow
             leftward from it.

             THE GAP GIVES BEFORE THE CLUSTER MOVES. A measure-opening cluster
             may reach back past the `nx - 16` floor that keeps it off the
             barline at `nx - 18`. When it does, `overrun` is how far, and the
             gap closes by half of it on each side, which buys back exactly
             that much and holds the right edge where it was. Only when the
             whole gap is spent does the cluster move right, and at that point
             `gap` is 0 and the arithmetic is increment 1's exactly, so the
             behaviour Dann walked on 2026-09-02 is what a cluster too wide for
             its bar still gets.

    /* ── AUGMENTATION DOTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
       Added 2026-08-28 on Dann's question: he could assign a dotted quarter
       and the arithmetic counted it, but nothing drew it. The correction half
       was complete — the dot cell reaches the stored diff, `durationFraction`
       gives a dot its 1.5x, and the measure tag counts it — and this file drew
       no dot at all.

       PLACEMENT IS GOULD'S, and the project already holds it: **r111, p.54**
       (`memo-gould-dimensional-priors_r1_2026-08-24.md`) — a duration dot sits
       about half a stave-space clear of the notehead, CENTRED IN A
       STAVE-SPACE, so a note sitting on a line takes the space ABOVE. That
       memo also flags r111's own hazard (its §4): half a space is inside the
       fill-in danger band, where a dot risks fusing into the notehead's ink at
       small sizes. The clearance is kept as Gould gives it and the caution is
       recorded here rather than silently widened.

       SIZE IS THE FONT'S, not a number of ours: the `augmentationDot` glyph
       was already in the registry (`smufl-metadata.ts:88`), so it is drawn and
       measured like every other glyph on the stave.

       THE SECOND DOT'S SPACING IS **NOT ESTABLISHED**. The priors memo covers
       one dot and says nothing about the gap between two, and the source is
       off this machine. Engraving convention is that a double dot repeats the
       same clearance, and that is what this does — marked so it can be checked
       if the book is ever photographed.

       AND IT CLEARS THE LEDGER LINES. A dot centred in a space can never land
       ON a ledger line, but outside the stave it would sit between two of
       them, so it is pushed past their extent rather than nested inside.

       `data-of-event` FOR THE SAME REASON THE ACCIDENTAL CARRIES IT: this is
       drawn outside the note's group, and the selection squircle unions by

       path cannot taper at all. What stood here was one quadratic at a constant
       1.1 px, which drew a ribbon of one width end to end.

       OUT ALONG THE OUTER EDGE AND BACK ALONG THE INNER. The two curves share
       both terminals, so the shape meets at points there and swells to
       `TIE_CENTRE_SP` at the middle; the inner control is pulled toward the
       chord, which is what makes the swell. Everything that decided WHERE the
       tie goes is untouched: the terminals are still the two noteheads' own
       edges (`half1`, `half2` above), the height is still `lineGap * 0.9` with
       the staff-line nudge, and the direction is still chosen by the syllabic
       slur, then timbre, then staff position.

  // defaults to a fixed 96 px and no caller scales it with `lineGap`, so on
  // the print sheet's 5.5 px stave every system reserved about 85 px above a
  // 22 px staff and a page fitted four systems where six belong (Dann at the
  // browser, 2026-08-06). Shrinking `staffMidY` would move every coordinate
  // in the system and could clip a high tessitura; cropping the viewBox
  // leaves every element's own y untouched, so the `data-event-id`
  // hit-testing math is unaffected, and the headroom is sized by what
  // actually occupies it (Gould r184: a gap is sized by what must live
  // inside it), never by a constant.

  // `paginateScore` MUST read this viewBox's min-y. `viewBoxOf` was written
  // when the origin was always 0.
